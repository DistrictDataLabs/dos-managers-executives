The scope of standardization is to present these data in a less detailed form for a selected number of commodities without causing any significant loss of the basic variables monitoring the agricultural sector. The selected commodities include the equivalents of their derived products falling in the same commodity group, but exclude the equivalents of by-products and derived commodities, which through processing, change their nature and become part of different commodity groups. A number of commodity/item aggregates have been included to offer synthetic information. Some of these are included with the aim of simplifying the extraction of all component commodities. Data shown in the item aggregates represent the sum of the component commodities as presented in this domain (standardized form). Commodity coverage: The commodity list in this domain has been generally confined to primary commodities - except for sugar, oils and fats and beverages.  Whenever possible trade in processed commodities is expressed in the originating primary commodity equivalent. Rice is expressed in milled equivalent.</DatasetDescription><Contact>Mr. Salar Tayyib</Contact><Email>faostat@fao.org</Email><DateUpdate>2018-01-16</DateUpdate><CompressionFormat>zip</CompressionFormat><FileType>csv</FileType><FileSize>46296KB</FileSize><FileRows>7695363</FileRows><FileLocation>http://fenixservices.fao.org/faostat/static/bulkdownloads/CommodityBalances_Crops_E_All_Data_(Normalized).zip</FileLocation></Dataset><Dataset><DatasetCode>BL</DatasetCode><DatasetName>Food Balance: Commodity Balances - Livestock and Fish Primary Equivalent</DatasetName><Topic>Most crop and livestock products, including processed products, under agricultural activity.</Topic><DatasetDescription>Food supply data is some of the most important data in FAOSTAT.

Data are collected from other FAOSTAT domains, in particular from Investment and Macro Indicators. The purpose is to give to the users have a comprehensive dataset that allows making comparison among the different flows to agriculture within each country. The dataset consists of a time series of more than 200 countries, from 2001 onwards. The information included regards the levels of central government expenditure on agriculture, credit to agriculture, official Development Flows (commitment) and foreign direct investment on agriculture. Besides the variables regarding the levels of investment flows, the dataset also includes the agriculture value added and the agriculture gross fixed capital formation. Additional indicators reported are the share of total flow allocated to agriculture (for Government Expenditure on Agriculture, Credit to Agriculture, Development Flows, Foreign direct Investment to Agriculture), the agriculture share of total GDP, the agriculture share of total gross fixed capital formation, the agriculture orientation index (ratio of the agriculture share of total flow, over the agriculture value added share of total GDP) for Government Expenditure on Agriculture, Credit to Agriculture, Development Flows to Agriculture, the investment agriculture orientation index (which is the ratio between the agriculture share of gross fixed capital formation over the agriculture share of GDP), the annual growth, the investment ratio (ratio between gross fixed capital formation over GDP) and the agriculture investment ratio (ratio between agriculture gross fixed capital formation and agriculture value added). Though the goal is to have complete and consistent coverage for all countries, relatively low response rates for the different databases belonging to the investment domain and country level differences in data collection and reporting creates some challenges in providing a complete and consistent global dataset.</DatasetDescription><Contact>Sangita Dubey</Contact><Email>sangita.dubey@fao.org; investment-data@fao.org</Email><DateUpdate>2017-12-19</DateUpdate><CompressionFormat>zip</CompressionFormat><FileType>csv</FileType><FileSize>600KB</FileSize><FileRows>66007</FileRows><FileLocation>http://fenixservices.fao.org/faostat/static/bulkdownloads/Investment_CountryInvestmentStatisticsProfile__E_All_Data_(Normalized).zip</FileLocation></Dataset><Dataset><DatasetCode>CL</DatasetCode><DatasetName>Food Balance: Food Supply - Livestock and Fish Primary Equivalent</DatasetName><Topic>Most crop and livestock products, including processed products, under agricultural activity.</Topic><DatasetDescription>Food supply data is some of the most important data in FAOSTAT.

In 2014, IMF-ILO-FAO agreed to transfer global CPI data compilation from ILO to IMF. Upon agreement, CPIs for all items and its sub components originates from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), and the UN Statistics Division(UNSD) for countries not covered by the IMF. However, due to a limited time coverage from IMF and UNSD for a number of countries, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the Latin America and the Caribbean statistics (CEPALSTAT), Central Bank of Western African States (BCEAO), Eastern Caribbean Central Bank (ECCB) and national statistical office website data are used for missing historical data from IMF and UNSD food CPI. The FAO CPI dataset for all items(or general CPI) and the Food CPI, consists of a complete and consistent set of time series from January 2000 onwards. These indices measure the price change between the current and reference periods of the average basket of goods and services purchased by households. The CPI,all items is typically used to measure and monitor inflation, set monetary policy targets, index social benefits such as pensions and unemployment benefits, and to escalate thresholds and credits in the income tax systems and wages in public and private wage contracts.</DatasetDescription><Contact>Mukesh Srivastava</Contact><Email>faostat@fao.org</Email><DateUpdate>2018-09-03</DateUpdate><CompressionFormat>zip</CompressionFormat><FileType>csv</FileType><FileSize>619KB</FileSize><FileRows>65218</FileRows><FileLocation>http://fenixservices.fao.org/faostat/static/bulkdownloads/ConsumerPriceIndices_E_All_Data_(Normalized).zip</FileLocation></Dataset><Dataset><DatasetCode>CS</DatasetCode><DatasetName>Macro-Statistics: Capital Stock</DatasetName><Topic>Agriculture, forestry and fishing (ISIC A+B Rev.3 and A Rev.4)</Topic><DatasetDescription>As part of the FAO Agriculture Capital Stock (ACS) database, ESS-FAO publishes country-by-country data on physical investment in agriculture, forestry and fishing as measured by the System of National Accounts (SNA) concept of Gross Fixed Capital Formation (GFCF). Additional variables included in the ACS are Net and Gross Capital Stock, Consumption of Fixed Capital, the Agriculture Investment ratio, and the Gross Fixed Capital Formation Agriculture Orientation Index.   The FAO Agriculture Capital Stock Database is an analytical database: whenever available, the database integrates official National Accounts data harvested from the UNSD National Accounts Main Aggregates Database (UNSD AMA) and the OECD Annual National Accounts Database (OECD ANA). If the full set of official data is not available for any specific country, imputation methods are applied to obtain estimates over the complete time series. Many data points in ACS are estimated and are flagged as such; they do not represent official Member countries' submissions.  With a view of producing internationally comparable net capital stock estimates, we employ the Perpetual Inventory Method (PIM) with a time invariant geometric depreciation rate to impute missing data. The Perpetual Inventory Method is a well-established economic model to calculate Net Capital Stocks (NCS) and Consumption of Fixed Capital (CFC) from time series of Gross Fixed Capital Formation (GFCF). Specifically, annual measures of the NCS are obtained from cumulating historical series on physical investment flows and deducting the part of assets that are depreciated (the Consumption of Fixed Capital that occurs in every period).   In order to implement the PIM, long time series on aggregate GFCF in agriculture, forestry and fishing is required. As much as possible, we rely on National Accounts data published by the OECD and UNSD. When country data are partially or fully missing, we employ econometric techniques to impute missing observations. Depending on the pattern of data missingness for the countries, different imputation methods are applied (selected from the ARMAX, PANEL and OLS classes of econometric models). Working with the above-mentioned data sources, we can rely on country data - though very incomplete in some cases - on agriculture GFCF, CFC and/or NCS for 103 countries to guide us in our data gap filling exercise. For the other 104 countries included in the database, we fully rely on imputation methods. For a detailed description of the imputation methods and our PIM framework, refer to box 20.5.   All data series in the database are provided both in national currencies and in US dollars as well as in current prices and constant prices with base year 2010. Calculation of constant price series is done applying GFCF deflator series. When OECD National Accounts data are available, an OECD implicit deflator for agriculture GFCF is calculated and used. For other cases, the implicit deflators on GFCF for total economy available from the FAOSTAT Deflators database is used.</DatasetDescription><Contact>Mr. Mukesh Srivastava</Contact><Email>macrostats@fao.org</Email><DateUpdate>2018-09-11</DateUpdate><CompressionFormat>zip</CompressionFormat><FileType>csv</FileType><FileSize>582KB</FileSize><FileRows>72838</FileRows><FileLocation>http://fenixservices.fao.org/faostat/static/bulkdownloads/Investment_CapitalStock_E_All_Data_(Normalized).zip</FileLocation></Dataset><Dataset><DatasetCode>EA</DatasetCode><DatasetName>Investment: Development Flows to Agriculture</DatasetName><Topic>Total economy, Agriculture, forestry and fisheries, environmental protection, rural development, and food security assistance/aid.</Topic><DatasetDescription>Data originates from OECD DAC, and is harvested from the Creditor Reporting System (CRS) database.

Agriculture is the main source of ammonia emissions, with shares ranging on average between 80% and 99%. Ammonia with sulphur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) contribute to acidification of soil and water when it combines with water in the atmosphere or after deposition. Deposition of ammonia can also raise nitrogen levels in soil and water, which may contribute to eutrophication in receiving aquatic ecosystems. Deposited ammonia can also contribute to the emissions of nitrous oxide, which is a GHG. Ammonia in the atmosphere can also combine with industrial and transport pollution generating secondary particulate pollution. Indicator: Ammonia (NH3) emissions from agriculture as a % of total NH3 emissions. Methodology: Share Ammonia from agriculture/total Ammonia emissions (%): (Total Ammonia emissions from agriculture)/(Total Ammonia emissions) * 100.  Data sources:  Total Ammonia emissions from agriculture (Gg) from European Monitoring and Evaluation Programme (EMEP). Total Ammonia emissions (Gg) from European Monitoring and Evaluation Programme (EMEP). Link: European Monitoring and Evaluation Programme (EMEP). The indicator in EUROSTAT and OECD frameworks:  Eurostat: AEI n.18, OECD: AEI n.2. Definition in the original frameworks: EUROSTAT: Main indicator:: Ammonia emissions from agriculture (ktonnes/yr); Supporting indicator: Share of agriculture in total ammonia emissions. OECD: Share of agricultural ammonia emissions in national total ammonia (NH3) emissions.  Data used in the original frameworks:  EU: Data provided annually for the NECD (National Emissions Ceiling Directive). OECD: UNECE/EMEP.

Agriculture also produces energy as biofuels and biomass production. As an energy user, Agriculture contributes to global warming (mainly through CO2 emissions, but also CH4 and N2O emissions), air pollution (mainly through NOx and SO2 emissions) and to the depletion of fossil energy resources. Important energy users are glasshouse horticulture, floriculture and dairy production. Agriculture can make a contribution to the mitigation of climate change and air pollution effects through more efficient energy use and through the production of renewable energy (bio-energy production). Indicator: Agriculture and forestry energy used as a % of total energy use, measured as Agr.Energy use/Total Energy Use)*100. BIOENERGY: Bioenergy refers to energy derived from the biological carbon fixation of plants or from biological tissues. Examples are biodiesel, derived from vegetable oils and animal fats, and bioethanol, produced by the fermentation of carbohydrates of crops like corn.  The production of biomass for energy production has important effects on rural development, international policy and economy, and on the environment: it supports the rural economy creating jobs and gives farmers a source of income complementary to food production. Biofuels have also an impact on economy and trade, since they reduce the dependence on oil-producing countries. Being derived from plants, their production contributes to carbon sequestration.  Biofuels production presents also some issues, such as the increased pressure on water resources, deforestation (to clear land to cultivate fuel crops), and the change in use of land originally intended for food production. Indicator: Bioenergy production as a % of total energy production. Methodology: Sum of different bioenergy (e.g. biodiesel, biogases). Share of bioenergy on renewable energy prod. = (Biofuels prod/Total renewable production)*100.</DatasetDescription><Contact>Francesco Nicola Tubiello</Contact><Email>faostat@fao.org</Email><DateUpdate>2013-05-16</DateUpdate><CompressionFormat>zip</CompressionFormat><FileType>csv</FileType><FileSize>161KB</FileSize><FileRows>10427</FileRows><FileLocation>http://fenixservices.fao.org/faostat/static/bulkdownloads/Environment_Energy_E_All_Data_(Normalized).zip</FileLocation></Dataset><Dataset><DatasetCode>EF</DatasetCode><DatasetName>Agri-Environmental Indicators: Fertilizers</DatasetName><Topic>Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use</Topic><DatasetDescription>The data describe the average use of chemical and mineral fertilizers per area of cropland (arable land and permanent crops) at national, regional, and global level in a time series from 2002 to 2015</DatasetDescription><Contact>Francesco Nicola Tubiello</Contact><Email>faostat@fao.org</Email><DateUpdate>2017-12-21</DateUpdate><CompressionFormat>zip</CompressionFormat><FileType>csv</FileType><FileSize>64KB</FileSize><FileRows>8160</FileRows><FileLocation>http://fenixservices.fao.org/faostat/static/bulkdownloads/Environment_Fertilizers_E_All_Data_(Normalized).zip</FileLocation></Dataset><Dataset><DatasetCode>EI</DatasetCode><DatasetName>Agri-Environmental Indicators: Emissions intensities</DatasetName><Topic>Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use, Greenhouse Gas Emissions</Topic><DatasetDescription>Intensities of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by production unit for a selection of agricultural commodities.</DatasetDescription><Contact>Francesco Nicola Tubiello</Contact><Email>faostat@fao.org</Email><DateUpdate>2018-05-08</DateUpdate><CompressionFormat>zip</CompressionFormat><FileType>csv</FileType><FileSize>3410KB</FileSize><FileRows>376431</FileRows><FileLocation>http://fenixservices.fao.org/faostat/static/bulkdownloads/Environment_Emissions_intensities_E_All_Data_(Normalized).zip</FileLocation></Dataset><Dataset><DatasetCode>EK</DatasetCode><DatasetName>Agri-Environmental Indicators: Livestock Patterns</DatasetName><Topic>Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (ISIC A)</Topic><DatasetDescription>The Livestock Patterns domain of the FAOSTAT Agri-Environmental Indicators contains data on livestock numbers, shares of major livestock species and livestock densities in the agricultural area. Values are calculated using Livestock Units (LSU), which facilitate aggregating information for different livestock types. Data are available by country, with global coverage, for the period 1961–2016. This methodology applies the LSU coefficients reported in the "Guidelines for the preparation of livestock sector reviews" (FAO, 2011). From this publication, LSU coefficients are computed by livestock type and by country. The reference unit used for the calculation of livestock units (=1 LSU) is the grazing equivalent of one adult dairy cow producing 3000 kg of milk annually, fed without additional concentrated foodstuffs.

Erosion is a natural process, but human activities can greatly influence its rate, especially through agriculture and deforestation. According to the U.N. Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, approximately 40% of the world's agricultural land is seriously degraded. In natural conditions, only very severe meteorological events will cause erosion, as the vegetation cover, the leaf litter and the organic matter will protect the soil absorbing rain impacts and preventing soil removal. Removal of the natural vegetation cover due to practices such as: deforestation; overgrazing; or industrial farming practices (e.g. tillage), leaves the soil exposed to the action of climatic factors, such as rain and wind. The global survey on human-induced soil degradation is the GLASOD (Global Assessment of Human-Induced Soil Degradation), prepared jointly by ISRIC and UNEP during the 1980’s. The GLASOD database is the only global dataset available on soil degradation. However, there are issues related to its quality, which is not homogeneous, and therefore statistics obtained from these maps are not always reliable (Sonneveld and Dent 2007). Better statistics on soil degradation will be possible with the new version of the FAO GLADIS dataset which should be released shortly. Soil quality can be defined as “the capacity of a specific kind of soil to function, within natural or managed ecosystem boundaries, to sustain plant and animal productivity, maintain or enhance water and air quality, and support human health and habitation. Soil quality is defined according to the soil functions (e.g. bearing function, production function, habitat function, resources function, reactor function) and cannot be measured by a single parameter. However, soil organic carbon has been defined by EUROSTAT as the more appropriate indicator for soil quality. High organic carbon content corresponds to good conditions from an agro-environmental point of view. Soils with organic carbon content less than 1% in weight are generally affected by soil degradation processes and erosion. On the other hand, soils with 1-10% organic carbon content have high agricultural value.The data used for the production of this indicator are geo-spatial raster data contained in the Harmonized World Soil Database (HWSD) released by FAO, IIASA, ISRIC, ISSCAS, and JRC in 2008 with a spatial resolution of 30 by 30 arc seconds (approximately 1 Km). Spatial data were extracted through appropriate queries from the geo-database and then spatial statistics were calculated at the country level.</DatasetDescription><Contact>Francesco Nicola Tubiello</Contact><Email>faostat@fao.org</Email><DateUpdate>2013-05-16</DateUpdate><CompressionFormat>zip</CompressionFormat><FileType>csv</FileType><FileSize>7KB</FileSize><FileRows>704</FileRows><FileLocation>http://fenixservices.fao.org/faostat/static/bulkdownloads/Environment_Soil_E_All_Data_(Normalized).zip</FileLocation></Dataset><Dataset><DatasetCode>ET</DatasetCode><DatasetName>Agri-Environmental Indicators: Temperature change</DatasetName><Topic>Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (ISIC A)</Topic><DatasetDescription>The Temperature Change domain of the FAOSTAT Agri-Environmental Indicators section contains data on observed mean surface temperature changes by country, over the period 1961-2017 with annual updates.

The food balance sheet shows for each food item - i.e. each primary commodity and a number of processed commodities potentially available for human consumption - the sources of supply and its utilization. The total quantity of foodstuffs produced in a country added to the total quantity imported and adjusted to any change in stocks that may have occurred since the beginning of the reference period gives the supply available during that period. On the utilization side a distinction is made between the quantities exported, fed to livestock, used for seed, put to manufacture for food use and non-food uses, losses during storage and transportation, and food supplies available for human consumption. The per caput supply of each such food item available for human consumption is then obtained by dividing the respective quantity by the related data on the population actually partaking of it. Data on per caput food supplies are expressed in terms of quantity and - by applying appropriate food composition factors for all primary and processed products - also in terms of caloric value and protein and fat content.</DatasetDescription><Contact>Mr. Salar Tayyib</Contact><Email>faostat@fao.org</Email><DateUpdate>2017-12-12</DateUpdate><CompressionFormat>zip</CompressionFormat><FileType>csv</FileType><FileSize>67676KB</FileSize><FileRows>12660686</FileRows><FileLocation>http://fenixservices.fao.org/faostat/static/bulkdownloads/FoodBalanceSheets_E_All_Data_(Normalized).zip</FileLocation></Dataset><Dataset><DatasetCode>FDI</DatasetCode><DatasetName>Investment: Foreign Direct Investment (FDI)</DatasetName><Topic>Total economy, Agriculture, forestry and fishery and Food, Beverages and Tobacco defined by ISIC Rev.4.</Topic><DatasetDescription>All data originates from the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) andthe International Trade Centre (INTRACEN).

The IMF is the responsible institution for the Government Finance Statistics (GFS) methodology and annually collects GFS data, including Expenditure by Functions of Government (COFOG). The Classification of the Functions of Government (COFOG) is an international classification developed by Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and published by the United Nations Statistical Division (UNSD), with the aim of categorise governments' functions according to their purposes. The FAO questionnaire aligns with Table 7 of the IMF GFS questionnaire, replicates the relevant aggregates and drills down to request additional detail related to Agriculture.The FAO dataset consists of a time series, from 2001 onwards, of Total Government Expenditure and expenditure in: Economic affairs; Agriculture, Forestry, Fishing and Hunting, along with its three disaggregated subsectors of Agriculture, Forestry and Fishing; and Environmental Protection. In addition, expenditure in each detailed function are further disaggregated into Recurrent and Capital expenditure. Additional indicators include the Agriculture Share of Government Expenditure, and the Agriculture Orientation Index (ratio between the Agriculture Share of Government Expenditure and the Agriculture Value Added as Share of GDP).Though the goal is to have complete and consistent coverage for all countries, different stages of implementation of the GFS methodology and COFOG classification, and differences in the data collection and reporting at country level creates some challenges in providing a complete and consistent global dataset.</DatasetDescription><Contact>Sangita Dubey</Contact><Email>Investment-Data@fao.org</Email><DateUpdate>2017-11-13</DateUpdate><CompressionFormat>zip</CompressionFormat><FileType>csv</FileType><FileSize>484KB</FileSize><FileRows>55795</FileRows><FileLocation>http://fenixservices.fao.org/faostat/static/bulkdownloads/Investment_GovernmentExpenditure_E_All_Data_(Normalized).zip</FileLocation></Dataset><Dataset><DatasetCode>LC</DatasetCode><DatasetName>Agri-Environmental Indicators: Land Cover</DatasetName><Topic>Land cover</Topic><DatasetDescription>The FAOSTAT domain Land Cover under the Agri-Environmental Indicators section contains land cover information organized by the land cover classes of the international standard system for Environmental and Economic Accounting Central Framework (SEEA CF).

It releases time series for a selection of National Accounts variables, including gross domestic product, gross fixed capital formation, industry-level value added and gross output. The database also proposes additional indicators such as per capita GDP, year-on-year growth rates and measures ofindustry contribution to GDP.  All data relating to TE, AFF, and to MAN originates from the United Nations Statistics Division (UNSD) National Accounts Estimates of Main Aggregates database, which consists of a complete and consistent set of time series of the main National Accounts (NA) aggregates of all UN Members States and other territories in the world for which National Accounts information is available.

A deflator is a figure expressing the change in prices over a period of time for a product or a basket of products by comparing a reference period to a base period. It is obtained by dividing a current price value of a given aggregate by its real counterpart. When calculated from the major national accounting aggregates such as GDP or agriculture VA, implicit price deflators pertains to wider ranges of goods and services in the economy than that represented by any of the individual price indexes (such as CPIs, PPIs). Movements in an implicit price deflator reflect both changes in price and changes in the composition of the aggregate for which the deflator is calculated.  In the FAOSTAT Deflators database, all series are derived from the United Nations Statistics Division (UNSD) National Accounts Estimates of Main Aggregates database (UNSD NAE). In particular, the implicit GDP deflator, the implicit GFCF deflator and the implicit value added deflator in Agriculture, Forestry, Fishery are obtained by dividing the series in current prices by those in constant 2010 prices (base year).</DatasetDescription><Contact>Ms. Sangita Dubey</Contact><Email>macrostats@fao.org</Email><DateUpdate>2018-03-15</DateUpdate><CompressionFormat>zip</CompressionFormat><FileType>csv</FileType><FileSize>738KB</FileSize><FileRows>72528</FileRows><FileLocation>http://fenixservices.fao.org/faostat/static/bulkdownloads/Deflators_E_All_Data_(Normalized).zip</FileLocation></Dataset><Dataset><DatasetCode>PE</DatasetCode><DatasetName>Prices: Exchange rates - Annual</DatasetName><Topic>All sectors.</Topic><DatasetDescription>Annual exchange rates, national currency units per U.S. dollar.</DatasetDescription><Contact>Eun Jeong LEE</Contact><Email>faostat@fao.org</Email><DateUpdate>2018-04-02</DateUpdate><CompressionFormat>zip</CompressionFormat><FileType>csv</FileType><FileSize>79KB</FileSize><FileRows>9664</FileRows><FileLocation>http://fenixservices.fao.org/faostat/static/bulkdownloads/Exchange_rate_E_All_Data_(Normalized).zip</FileLocation></Dataset><Dataset><DatasetCode>PI</DatasetCode><DatasetName>Prices: Producer Price Indices - Annual</DatasetName><Topic>Most crop and livestock products under agricultural activity</Topic><DatasetDescription>Indices of agricultural producer prices that measure the average annual change over time in the selling prices received by farmers (prices at the farm-gate or at the first point of sale).

Data are expressed in terms of area harvested, production quantity and yield. The objective is to comprehensively cover production of all primary crops for all countries and regions in the world.Cereals: Area and production data on cereals relate to crops harvested for dry grain only. Cereal crops harvested for hay or harvested green for food, feed or silage or used for grazing are therefore excluded. Area data relate to harvested area. Some countries report sown or cultivated area only; however, in these countries the sown or cultivated area does not differ significantly in normal years from the area actually harvested, either because practically the whole area sown is harvested or because the area surveys are conducted around the harvest period.Vegetables, total (including melons): Data relate to vegetable crops grown mainly for human consumption. Crops such as cabbages, pumpkins and carrots, when explicitly cultivated for animal feed, are therefore excluded. Statistics on vegetables are not available in many countries, and the coverage of the reported data differs from country to country. In general, it appears that the data refer to crops grown in field and market gardens mainly for sale, thus excluding crops cultivated in kitchen gardens or small family gardens mainly for household consumption.Fruit, total (excluding melons): Data refer to total production of fresh fruit, whether finally used for direct consumption for food or feed, or processed into different products: dry fruit, juice, jam, alcohol, etc. Generally, production data relate to plantation crops or orchard crops grown mainly for sale. Data on production from scattered trees used mainly for home consumption are not usually collected. Production from wild plants, particularly berries, which is of some importance in certain countries, is generally disregarded by national statistical services. Therefore, the data for the various fruits and berries are rather incomplete. Bananas and plantains: Figures on bananas refer, as far as possible, to all edible fruit-bearing species of the genus Musa except Musa paradisiaca, commonly known as plantain. Unfortunately, several countries make no distinction in their statistics between bananas and plantains and publish only overall estimates. When this occurs and there is some indication or assumption that the data reported refer mainly to bananas, the data are included. The production data on bananas and plantains reported by the various countries are also difficult to compare because a number of countries report in terms of bunches, which generally means that the stalk is included in the weight. Dates, plantains and total grapes are included in the “total fruit” aggregated figures, while olives are excluded.        Treenuts, aggregated: Production of nuts (including chestnuts) relates to nuts in the shell or in the husk. Statistics are very scanty and generally refer only to crops for sale. In addition to the kind of nuts shown separately, production data include all other treenuts mainly used as dessert or table nuts, such as pecan nuts, pili nuts, sapucaia nuts and macadamia nuts. Nuts mainly used for flavouring beverages are excludedas are masticatory and stimulant nuts and nuts used mainly for the extraction of oil or butter, including areca/betel nuts, cola nuts, illipe nuts, karate nuts, coconuts, tung nuts, oilpalm nuts etc.</DatasetDescription><Contact>Mr. Salar Tayyib</Contact><Email>faostat@fao.org</Email><DateUpdate>2018-05-28</DateUpdate><CompressionFormat>zip</CompressionFormat><FileType>csv</FileType><FileSize>18393KB</FileSize><FileRows>2306419</FileRows><FileLocation>http://fenixservices.fao.org/faostat/static/bulkdownloads/Production_Crops_E_All_Data_(Normalized).zip</FileLocation></Dataset><Dataset><DatasetCode>QD</DatasetCode><DatasetName>Production: Crops processed</DatasetName><Topic>Most crop products and processed crops under agricultural activity.</Topic><DatasetDescription>The dataset covers the following commodities: Beer of barley; Cotton lint; Cottonseed; Margarine, short; Molasses; Oil, coconut (copra); Oil, cottonseed; Oil, groundnut; Oil, linseed; Oil, maize; Oil, olive, virgin; Oil, palm; Oil, palm kernel; Oil, rapeseed; Oil, safflower; Oil, sesame; Oil, soybean; Oil, sunflower; Palm kernels; Sugar Raw Centrifugal; Wine.</DatasetDescription><Contact>Mr. Salar Tayyib</Contact><Email>faostat@fao.org</Email><DateUpdate>2017-05-17</DateUpdate><CompressionFormat>zip</CompressionFormat><FileType>csv</FileType><FileSize>882KB</FileSize><FileRows>223351</FileRows><FileLocation>http://fenixservices.fao.org/faostat/static/bulkdownloads/Production_CropsProcessed_E_All_Data_(Normalized).zip</FileLocation></Dataset><Dataset><DatasetCode>QI</DatasetCode><DatasetName>Production: Production Indices</DatasetName><Topic>Most crop products and processed crops under agricultural activity.</Topic><DatasetDescription>The dataset includes data on gross and net production indices for various food and agriculture aggregates expressed in both totals and per capita.</DatasetDescription><Contact>Mr. Salar Tayyib</Contact><Email>faostat@fao.org</Email><DateUpdate>2018-05-22</DateUpdate><CompressionFormat>zip</CompressionFormat><FileType>csv</FileType><FileSize>5144KB</FileSize><FileRows>657124</FileRows><FileLocation>http://fenixservices.fao.org/faostat/static/bulkdownloads/Production_Indices_E_All_Data_(Normalized).zip</FileLocation></Dataset><Dataset><DatasetCode>QL</DatasetCode><DatasetName>Production: Livestock Primary</DatasetName><Topic>Agriculture holdings and enterprises for processing of animals.</Topic><DatasetDescription>The dataset contains the following commodities and commodity aggregates thereof : Beeswax; Eggs (various types); Hair, horse; Hides buffalo, fresh; Hides, cattle, fresh; Honey, natural; Meat indigenous (ass, bird nes, buffalo, camel, cattle, chicken, duck, geese, goat, horse, mule, other camelids, pig, rabbit, rodents, sheep, turkey); Meat (ass, bird nes, buffalo, camel, cattle, chicken, duck, game, goat, goose and guinea fowl, horse, mule, Meat nes, meat other camelids, Meat other rodents, pig, rabbit, sheep, turkey); Milk (buffalo, camel, cow, goat, sheep); Offals, nes; Silk-worm cocoons, reelable; Skins, furs; Skins (goat, sheep); Snails, not sea; Wool, greasy.Meat: Data relate to animals slaughtered within national boundaries, irrespective of their origin. All data shown relate to total meat production, that is, from both commercial and farm slaughter. Data are given in terms of dressed carcass weight, excluding offal and slaughter fats. Production of beef and buffalo meat includes veal; mutton and goat meat includes meat from lambs and kids; pig meat includes bacon and ham in fresh equivalent. Poultry meat includes meat from all domestic birds and refers, wherever possible, to ready-to-cook weight. Data on poultry-meat production reported by national statistical offices could be expressed in terms of either live weight, eviscerated weight, ready-to-cook weight or dressed weight. Data for countries reporting in other than ready-to-cook weight have been converted into the ready-to-cook equivalent.Milk: Data on milk production relate to total production of whole fresh milk, excluding the milk sucked by young animals but including amounts fed to livestock. Eggs: Some countries have no statistics on egg production, and estimates had to be derived from such related data as chicken or total poultry numbers and reported or assumed rates of egg laying. Most of the countries that have statistics on egg production report either the total weight of eggs or the numbers of eggs produced. Data generally refer to total production, including eggs for hatching, in both agricultural and non-agricultural sectors.Wool: Wool production statistics are generally given for greasy wool, which contains from 30 to 65 percent impurities. In order to make figures comparable, data are also given on a degreased (scoured) basis.Honey: Production data should cover the amount sold by beekeepers plus other recorded collection of honey.

The pesticides traded for retail sale or as preparations or articles are those classified under code 38.08 in the Harmonized System Nomenclature (HS) and include: hazardous pesticides, insecticides, fungicides, herbicides, disinfectants and other. For these pesticides, this domain contains trade data (imports and exports) in values only (current 1000 US dollars), and the time series extends from 1961 onwards. The pesticides traded as separate chemically defined compounds are those listed in Annex III of the Rotterdam Convention (excluding industrial chemicals) and therefore subject to the Prior Informed Consent (PIC) procedure. The correspondence with the HS Nomenclature is shown in the table  at the Related Documents section. For these pesticides, this domain contains trade data (imports and exports) in both value (current 1000 US dollars) and quantity (net weight in tonnes), and the time series extends from 2007 onwards.</DatasetDescription><Contact>Francesco Nicola Tubiello</Contact><Email>faostat@fao.org</Email><DateUpdate>2018-08-07</DateUpdate><CompressionFormat>zip</CompressionFormat><FileType>csv</FileType><FileSize>785KB</FileSize><FileRows>83228</FileRows><FileLocation>http://fenixservices.fao.org/faostat/static/bulkdownloads/Inputs_Pesticides_Trade_E_All_Data_(Normalized).zip</FileLocation></Dataset><Dataset><DatasetCode>RV</DatasetCode><DatasetName>Inputs: Fertilizers - Trade Value</DatasetName><Topic>Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (ISIC A)</Topic><DatasetDescription>The dataset contains data on Import and Export Value (expressed in 1000 USD) for a selected list of fertilizers, from 1961onwards.
