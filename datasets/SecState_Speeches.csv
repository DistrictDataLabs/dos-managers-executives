On behalf of the Department of State, I would like to wish a Merry Christmas to all those celebrating today, together with Orthodox Christians celebrating in early January.


This joyful occasion brings Christian communities together to rejoice in the birth of Jesus. In addition to celebrating and spending time with loved ones, the spirit of Christmas reminds us of Jesus’ message of hope, mercy, and love of neighbor. This season reminds us to care for the less fortunate, including those communities around the world today who are not able to observe this holiday freely due to persecution or instability.


Again, a very Merry Christmas to those celebrating around the world. May you be surrounded by family, friends, and neighbors during this festive season.

QUESTION: Thanks very much for taking the time.


SECRETARY POMPEO: You bet, Steve.


QUESTION: Is ISIS defeated?


SECRETARY POMPEO: We’ve made the caliphate in Syria go away. We remember, you remember this, Steve. You remember cells with people in them being burned. The President made an enormous commitment to take down the caliphate and that has been achieved. We now have the battle that is a longtime battle, which is the counterterrorism battle not only against ISIS but against al-Qaida and others, HTS – all the terrorist groups. President Trump remains just as committed today as he was yesterday and the day before, and the progress that the Trump administration has made in defeating ISIS in Syria is extraordinary and we’re very proud of that accomplishment.


QUESTION: When U.S. troops leave eastern Syria, of course, U.S. allies – Kurdish groups – will remain in eastern Syria. What obligations does the United States have to its Kurdish allies?


SECRETARY POMPEO: We’re at the State Department. We’ve been working diligently for a long time, including the entirety of my time in service here, to achieve the UN process led by Staffan de Mistura and now by his successor to get a political outcome in Syria that takes down the threat – the threat of violence, that attempts to create the conditions for what is now over 6 million displaced persons, some of them internal to Syria, some of them in Lebanon, Jordan, and Turkey. We are committed to that. Ambassador Jeffrey is hard at work trying to implement --


QUESTION: Jim Jeffrey, the envoy for Syria.


SECRETARY POMPEO: The special envoy for Syria is today hard at work trying to deliver against the UN commitments. We’re counting on the Russians, we’re counting on the Turks, we’re counting on each of those parties to honor their commitments to these – this UN Security Council resolution, and the United States will continue to lead those diplomat efforts.


QUESTION: Well, let’s talk about the Russians and the Turks. The Turks, who, of course, have been hostile to the Kurds, have already said they’re preparing to move into eastern Syria. The Russians have --


SECRETARY POMPEO: A lot of history, Steve. You shouldn’t enter that debate today. (Laughter.) The history between the Turks – the history between the Turks and the --


QUESTION: Would you warn the Turks against attacking --


SECRETARY POMPEO: Just – we have to – there’s a lot history, Steve. Some folks want to just talk about what happened this morning. The history between the Turks and the Kurdish is a long one, it is a complicated one, and the United States is deeply aware of the set of relationships there, and we have a very clear mission set. Our mission set in Syria was the defeat of the ISIS caliphate. We continue to push back against ISIS in West Africa, in Afghanistan, all across the world. That threat certainly is out there. The President has acknowledged that. He has also acknowledged the administration’s continued commitment to that defeat, something that the previous administration could not accomplish.


QUESTION: But I’m asking you about something a little different here. The Russian foreign ministry has said in the last day that the withdrawal of U.S. troops creates good prospects for a peaceful solution, and they gave the example of Aleppo, where the Syrian government backed by Russia went in, destroyed U.S. allies, and took over. Would you warn the Syrian government against moving against the Kurdish allies that you’re leaving behind?


SECRETARY POMPEO: I don’t give much credit to the Russian statements on much of anything, to be honest with you, Steve. Here’s what I know: The United States made a commitment. We led a global Defeat ISIS campaign to take down the caliphate in Syria. We have achieved that. The effort that – I’ve spoken to European counterparts, Middle Eastern counterparts over the last week to 10 days. This effort, this Defeat ISIS coalition, remains, and we are clear-eyed about the risks to the United States from terrorism and we will yield to no one in our efforts to defeat it.


QUESTION: On terrorism, no commitment to U.S. allies left behind in Syria, then?


SECRETARY POMPEO: We always have commitments to our allies. We’ve done this relentlessly. You all have reported differently, Steve. I get it. I get the game. But you all report this differently. Our – the American commitment to our allies, not just in this situation but all across the world – you report that America is withdrawing from the world when, in fact, just the opposite has taken place. President Trump and our State Department has led a global American leadership campaign that is unrivaled. We’re incredibly proud of it. Our allies see that. We stare at things that don’t work anymore and we demand that they begin to work. This is not only in the best interests of America but our allies as well, Steve.


QUESTION: I’ll just mention – I know time is short, but we can set aside – if there’s a specific NPR story you ever think is wrong, let us know.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Believe me, I assure you I’ll do that.


QUESTION: Let me ask about another subject. Has North Korea’s Kim Jong-un let you down?


SECRETARY POMPEO: We’ve known from the very first trip that I took when I was in a previous role that the challenge of denuclearizing North Korea was not one that would be something that would be easy or without bumps in the road or would occur in a way that was like instant pudding. The world doesn’t quite work that way.


We have diplomatically, relentlessly worked to support the President’s mission statement, which is to denuclearize North Korea. We got the commitment from Chairman Kim. We’ve made some progress. There remains a long ways to go, but we are hard at even today.


QUESTION: But they haven’t agreed to give an accounting of their nuclear weapons, which is something you wanted, and as time passes they’re beginning to get concessions. North and South Korea are talking about reopening roads and railroads. The United States is working to loosen travel restrictions. North Korea is getting benefits without giving things up.


SECRETARY POMPEO: The North Koreans have not suffered an economic sanctions regime like the one that the Trump administration has imposed and continues to impose ever.


QUESTION: Will --


SECRETARY POMPEO: Ever, Steve. I mean, you say things and they’re just unfounded, Steve. You say we’re going to loosen travel restrictions when, if you read the statement very clearly, we’re working to make sure that humanitarian assistance can be delivered.


QUESTION: It is a narrow --


SECRETARY POMPEO: It is right – it’s in the statement, Steve. Don’t read half of it. Read it all.


QUESTION: I read it all.


SECRETARY POMPEO: It’s important because this has deep connotations. You’re suggesting to your listeners that somehow we’re relaxing the economic sanctions campaign. Nothing could be further from the truth. The truth of the matter is that we are very consistent with what we’ve done before, making sure that where there is real need, real humanitarian need there, that we don’t deny that to the people of North Korea. And sometimes it takes getting an American to be able to travel in there to achieve that, and where that’s the case we want to facilitate that.


QUESTION: I think it is fair to say they, however, have been evasive. They’ve been canceling meetings with your diplomats. Has Kim Jong-un let you down?


SECRETARY POMPEO: It’s been a great process. They’re not firing rockets. They’re not conducting nuclear tests. We have a ways to go, and we will continue to achieve – to work to achieve the President’s agenda.


QUESTION: The second summit’s going to happen?


SECRETARY POMPEO: I’m counting on it.


QUESTION: Okay, let me ask about another thing briefly because I know this is something where you’re making an announcement as we’re speaking, having to do with the way that asylum seekers will be treated.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Yes, sir.


QUESTION: They’ll be kept south of the U.S. border while they apply for asylum, which is something the administration has been working toward. There’s a related matter that you commented on the other day. You said ideally you would cut off the flow of asylum seekers, they would not be coming out of Central America. What is the U.S. government doing to improve conditions in Central America, if anything, so that there are fewer people heading north?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Yeah. So the program that you spoke about that Secretary Nielsen and I are announcing this morning is a fundamental shift. It’s consistent with U.S. law, and more importantly it is deeply consistent with the protection, the humanitarian protection, of these migrants as they transit their way through Mexico. We will no longer permit those who are seeking asylum to remain inside the United States during the pendency of their immigration process. They’ll file a claim and then they will be returned to Mexico. The Mexican government will be – has or shortly will be issuing a statement talking about how they will ensure that those migrants are protected and that they’ll get access to counsel, visas if they need them. This is both deeply lawful and deeply humanitarian.


With respect to reducing the flow, we think this will help. We think this will disincentivize folks who think that if they can make the transit through Mexico – a very difficult and arduous journey where terrible things often happen to these migrants – we think they will realize that they won’t be able to stay in the United States and disappear into our country, something that we do think creates an incentive for them to come here. So we think this alone will greatly reduce the migration flows.


And then we made an announcement on Tuesday about efforts that we’ll make, commitments, financial commitments for good projects that we hope will lead to conditions where fewer folks will want to leave Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, and make this arduous journey.


QUESTION: And that’s in the U.S. interest to invest in Central America?


SECRETARY POMPEO: We always know it’s in the best interests of the world for people who are in difficult conditions to have better economic outcomes. We hope American business will travel there and create opportunities for these people who are in difficult conditions in those countries.


QUESTION: What would you say, Mr. Secretary, to officials in China, or North Korea, or Iran, for that matter, who may feel that they should try to outwait the Trump administration, that the President will not be here forever, that he’s been politically weakened lately?


SECRETARY POMPEO: I don’t talk about politics. I’m hoping I get to be the Secretary of State for six more years.


QUESTION: I hear the hope. I hear the hope. Okay, Mr. Secretary, thanks so much.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Great. Thank you very much, Steve.

"December 20, 2018","
QUESTION: Good morning, Secretary. How are you?


SECRETARY POMPEO: I’m very good.


QUESTION: I’ll just jump right in, since our time is limited.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Yes, sir.


QUESTION: My first question is kind of a two-part question. And the first part of it is, what is it – from your perspective as Secretary of State and what you do working with other countries’ leaders, what is kind of the goal of the tariffs with China? And is achieving that goal worth the cost to farmers and manufacturers here in the United States?


SECRETARY POMPEO: So the President’s mission with respect to trade in China is very, very clear. I saw this when I ran a small business in Kansas. The trade relationship with China is fundamentally unfair. They charge huge tariffs for the products that we try and sell there; they steal our intellectual property when we move our businesses there. That is unacceptable. It hurts Kansas workers.


And so the President’s mission in his dealings with China on trade is to create a fair and reciprocal relationship. If they would get rid of their tariffs and they would stop stealing our intellectual property and – those are the simple things he’s asking for. It’s only fair to Kansas workers to do that, and it’s the mission set that the President’s engaged in with the tariffs. It is – his aim is to create a fair and reciprocal trade relationship so that American workers can produce products and sell them on an equal footing into the Chinese market, in the same way China has been able to do in the United States for decades.


QUESTION: Do you believe that you’re making headwind in that area – or headway, sorry, not headwind. Do you believe that you’re making some movement there in trying to prevent some of that intellectual property theft through the use of these tariffs?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Yes, but it’s difficult. The Chinese have this as a method which they have used with great intent over the years. And they’re – they don’t want to give that up easily, and so it is a real challenge. It takes hard-fought negotiating, hard-fought diplomacy, hard-fought trade and discussions with Department of Treasury in the United States. But we are determined to do this.


It is fundamentally unfair to allow the United States to continue to have the Chinese have forced technology transfer, force American companies who want to operate in China to behave in ways that are inconsistent with their own workers’ best interest. And President Trump is the first president in an awfully long time to take this threat to American workers, Kansas farmers seriously.


QUESTION: Moving away a little bit from the trade issues, what would you have to say to some of the U.S. allies who are upset or surprised by President Trump’s announcement that he’s removing ground troops from Syria?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Oh, goodness. The U.S. efforts under President Trump in Syria have had extraordinary success. We’ve taken away more than 90 percent of the ISIS caliphate. You’ll remember, they were holding people in cages and lighting them on fire. We’ve eliminated over 90 percent of the actual real estate the caliphate held. We’ve had a very successful effort there. We will continue to keep the homeland safe from the threat from ISIS.


But it no longer makes sense for there to be 2,000 soldiers stationed there. We can accomplish this mission in a different way. And the President’s made a decision to do that. Our allies know the United States will always be the world’s leader in fighting against terrorism around the world. We’ve done it for decades, and we will continue to be alongside them, making sure that not only is America safe, but the threat from terrorism around the world is diminished.


QUESTION: Just lastly, because our time is running short, what are the next steps in talks or plans for talks with North Korea? And do you think that they are living up to some of the agreements that President Trump made the last time that he met with Kim Jong-un?


SECRETARY POMPEO: So I never talk about the actual discussions we’re having, because they’re private conversations on how to work our pathway forward toward the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. We’re very hopeful that we can make a significant step. The next public objective is that Chairman Kim and President Trump have both indicated that they want to have a summit, and I am hopeful that not too long after the first of the year we can get the two of them together and make another substantial step along the way towards creating a reduced threat to the United States from North Korea’s nuclear weapons arsenal.


QUESTION: Excellent. Thank you so much for your time. And I know you’re extremely busy, and I appreciate you giving me a moment.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Thank you very much, sir. You have a great day and a Merry Christmas.


QUESTION: You too. Thank you.


SECRETARY POMPEO: You bet. So long.


QUESTION: Bye-bye.

QUESTION: (Inaudible.)


SECRETARY POMPEO: Sure. So the President’s decision to withdraw the couple thousand folks that we’ve had in Syria is based on the fact that the effort there to crush the caliphate, the ISIS caliphate in the region, is now near completion. We had remarkable success: over 90-plus percent of the real estate that ISIS owned in which they attacked people in the West from that place is gone. We’ve achieved that mission and now it’s time to make sure that we continue to fight ISIS – they exist not only in Syria but around the world – but do so in a way that reduces the risk to American soldiers. The President made that decision and we will, in an orderly way, make a transition so that we can continue to keep Americans safe without expending as much blood and treasure of the American people in Syria.


QUESTION: So with that being said, Mr. Secretary, as I alluded to, Fort Riley, the Big Red One, is sending soldiers to Afghanistan in February. What is the status of the relations in the Middle East right now?


SECRETARY POMPEO: So our – the Middle East continues to be a place where terror emanates. We have to make sure that we do everything we can to prevent that terror from reaching our homeland, from attacking Americans certainly in the United States but Americans that travel around the world. We’ve watched Iran be the world’s largest state sponsor of terror from that region, and this administration has begun a massive campaign to put pressure on the Islamic Republic of Iran to stop that terror. We’ve done so by building out coalitions with our partners in the Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, all around the Middle East, our Israeli partners, to do just that – to create stability in the Middle East and prevent terror attacks on our homeland.


QUESTION: So switching topics here, Mr. Secretary, leading up to ongoing trade negotiations. How would you explain China’s attitude towards the United States?


SECRETARY POMPEO: China has had for a long time before this administration an incredibly unfair trade relationship with our country. I saw that when I was a member of Congress from Kansas. Farmers who tried to sell their products into China, our aviation builders, our manufacturers all across the state couldn’t get a fair shake. There weren’t reciprocal, fair arrangements between the United States and China. President Trump is aiming to fix that. The negotiations that are underway are very much aimed at that. And what the President asks for is simply this: He wants fairness and reciprocity. If the Chinese can sell their products here, we ought to be able to take American products built by American workers and send them to China and serve their customers as well.


I hope we can get that done in the next few months, but the President is determined to achieve that outcome on behalf of the American worker.


QUESTION: And with that being said, after entering into a new trade agreement with Canada and Mexico, the USMCA, please explain the relationship between the two countries moving forward.


SECRETARY POMPEO: It’s good I’ve had a chance to actually meet the incoming – or now the current – president of Mexico. I work closely with my counterpart there. I work closely with my counterpart in Canada. We now have the USMCA, which we believe will, again, be much more fair to American workers and create a North American trading system that will be the envy of the world. It’ll be good for workers all across America, including those in Kansas.


QUESTION: Secretary, I know we don’t have a lot of time and we could really spend hours talking about each of these questions. But as briefly as you could, could you explain the status of U.S.-Russia relations?


SECRETARY POMPEO: So it’s been a real challenge during our time. President Trump very much understands that this is a nuclear-armed state and to the extent we can find places where we can cooperate and work together, that benefits America. But they have proven not to be reliable partners across almost every front. What they did in Ukraine, the actions they took against our elections – all of these things create risk for the American people and President Trump has been very strong in communicating to the Russians that this kind of behavior is simply unacceptable and we’ve done all that we can to deter it.


QUESTION: Just one more question, Mr. Secretary. From representing Kansas to leading the nation’s highest intelligence agency, and now coming up on a year as our country’s top foreign diplomat, how has your experience in Kansas influenced your work in foreign relations?


SECRETARY POMPEO: I think about home a lot. I think about Kansas all the time as I travel the world. The people that I knew there shaped me. When I ran a small business there, I came to understand how important it is to make sure American workers have opportunity to sell their products around the world. Everything about my life in Kansas shapes what I do every day. It’s an incredible privilege to be America’s most senior diplomat and serve President Trump, and Kansas certainly is sitting there when I’m with the President, well represented.


QUESTION: All right, Mr. Secretary, we are outside our five-minute window. I appreciate you taking the time to speak with us. Are you okay with everything that I asked and everything that was said?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Yes, sir. It’s all good.


QUESTION: Well, it was much appreciated, Mr. Secretary. And you have a great Christmas.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Thank you. Merry Christmas to you too. So long, sir.


QUESTION: Thank you. Bye.

QUESTION: Pompeo is with us now. I don’t know what’s been happening, Mr. Secretary, but oh my gosh, we tried to get you on, couldn’t hear you. We’re doing shadow puppets over here. Hey, Mr. Secretary. How are you?


SECRETARY POMPEO: (Laughter.) Laura, good morning. I’m good. Thank you. How are you today?


QUESTION: Good. It’s our last show so I wanted to bring on my faves, and you made the list. Isn’t that amazing?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Congratulations on 17-plus years of excellence.


QUESTION: Oh, thank you very much. The soundbite we played for you when we were coming in was a series of comments made by Republicans criticizing the President’s decision to pull troops out of Syria. Number one, were you – did you get a heads-up on this decision? And number two, why is this the right decision now?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Well, Laura, this was a decision that was made with lots of consultation between all the senior-level officials, including myself, with the President. So yes, did I – I had more than a heads-up.


Second, remember the mission statement there. The primary reason – and the President’s talked about this – was to take down the caliphate. We remember folks in cages being lit on fire. The primary mission was to go take down the ISIS caliphate. That is at the very tail end of completion. And we have ISIS remnants in lots of pockets around the world.


Your listeners should be assured that the United States of America intends to continue that counterterrorism campaign, continue the fight against ISIS, whether it stems from Syria or other places. The decision to remove those folks from Syria does not diminish the enormous success this administration has had in the Middle East fighting terrorism.


QUESTION: There’s a – I know there’s a big announcement today about what we’re going to be doing with Mexico and perhaps Central America vis-a-vis our border and other efforts to keep people in their homelands, where they’re going to be working and able to raise their children there and hold on to their own culture and so forth. What can you tell us?


SECRETARY POMPEO: So we’re announcing today what I think is a truly groundbreaking plan to keep illegal aliens out of the United States. It is a very significant border security development. It will no longer be the case that aliens who come here remain inside the United States during the pendency of their asylum claims.


So the idea of catch and release will be replaced with catch and return. We expect this will result in a truly historic drop in illegal immigration, because the incentive to come here – file an asylum claim and remain in the United States during the pendency of that claim – will no longer exist.


QUESTION: And is this in consultation with other countries’ presidents and leadership so they are on board with the receiving of migrants back to their home countries?


SECRETARY POMPEO: So we will be returning the detainees to Mexico – or, excuse me, the illegal aliens to Mexico. We’ve made clear to the Mexican Government our intent to do this, and they have made an announcement – or shortly will make an announcement – about how they’re going to deal with those returned migrants. They’re going to offer them opportunities inside of their country to protect the rights of those migrants, but they will not be inside the United States during the time that their asylum claim is being processed.


QUESTION: Oh, that’s – this is a groundbreaking move. And I know you’ve been working on – I know – I follow your travel schedule from afar and I kind of see where – thinking, hmm, Pompeo and Nielsen – they’re up to something. Something – and I was hoping there was something good.


But you always have to deal with the lawsuits. You’ve had ACLU and various migrant groups and NGOs getting together, pooling money, pooling resources. And you have these nationwide permanent and temporary injunctions that continue to thwart the President’s article – his Article III authority to – I mean Article I authority, excuse me – to protect our country. And what are you going to do about that? Because you know the moment this is announced they’re going to take you to court.


SECRETARY POMPEO: So we hope that’s not the case, but we expect that you’re right about that. This is pretty clear. The Immigration and Naturalization Act’s Section 235 makes clear that the President has the authority to do this; it’s under existing law. And we remain convinced that this is a power that the President was granted by Congress to execute exactly the way we have. We’ve had lots of thought and legal review of this. We are confident that we are on firm ground. And we know that the fact that these folks will be taken care of – they’ll get more help in Mexico – will solve the problem we’ve had of folks coming into the United States, claiming asylum, and then disappearing into our country during the pendency of their claim.


QUESTION: Okay. So when someone comes here – let’s say they walk across the border; they claim asylum and cite – they make the credible fear threshold, persecution in homeland, which is – again, we got a judge yesterday, Emmet Sullivan, who has basically said you – gang violence and domestic abuse both count now as asylum categories. So at that point, when they claim asylum, their case would be pending. Would they have to then go back home, if they claim – make that threshold claim of credible fear?


SECRETARY POMPEO: So there will obviously be a detailed process for the claims that these folks will be making. I’ll leave to DHS to talk about the details of how that will be processed. But this is a fundamental shift in how the United States is going to handle the disposition of these illegal aliens during the time that their claim is being processed. We’re confident we’re on firm legal ground and we think this is, frankly, in the best interest of these migrants as well. We think that they will now see that they can’t disappear inside the United States, and so they will remain in their home countries, a place that doesn’t present all the risks that we have seen to these migrants, these illegal aliens entering the United States, that comes from making the transit through Mexico into our country.


QUESTION: Mr. Secretary, I know you have to hop in a second. But this survey that came out a few days ago that was parroted and trumpeted all over certain cable stations, cable outlets – CEOs say that they often have to apologize to their business partners abroad for Trump’s diplomacy. Three quarters of CEOs say they’ve apologized for the President. Your reaction to those CEOs?


SECRETARY POMPEO: I didn’t see that survey. That’s ridiculous. America remains a global leader on every front. President Trump has exerted American influence in a way that protects America, that understands that American sovereignty matters and that other nations’ sovereignty matters too. We and every American citizen should be rightfully proud of American diplomacy in the Trump administration.


QUESTION: All right. And will there be any news or announcements on China before the end of the year?


SECRETARY POMPEO: (Laughter.) Stand by.


QUESTION: Okay. Mr. Secretary --


SECRETARY POMPEO: I know it’s your last show, but nothing to add on that.


QUESTION: Oh, darn. Mr. Secretary, thank you so much for joining us. Have a merry Christmas, to you and your family.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Merry Christmas.


QUESTION: And we just appreciate you so much. And you’ve done such a great job, both at the CIA and at State and a great team there as well. So thank you so much for joining us.

QUESTION: Hey, as promised, let us now welcome at this time U.S. Secretary of State, former Kansas congressman, Mike Pompeo. Good morning, Mr. Secretary.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Ted, it’s great to be with you. How you been?


QUESTION: Just fine. And we certainly are able to keep track of you these days. You are front and center. This is – could you please, first of all, update us on what’s happening between the U.S. and North Korea these days?


SECRETARY POMPEO: You bet. So, Ted, first of all, thanks for giving me a few minutes to come back on the show. I have great memories of doing this when I was a member of Congress. And now I got this privilege where I get to represent the United States as its senior diplomat in places like North Korea. And we have – we still are working through the execution of Chairman Kim’s commitment to denuclearize. I’ve traveled there now, oh goodness, three or four times. We’ll continue to have meetings, and we are hopeful that in the new year President Trump and Chairman Kim will get together not too long after the first of the year and make even further progress on taking this threat to the United States away from us.


QUESTION: In a better situation with them than we were a year ago, obviously?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Undoubtedly. No more missiles being tested, no more nuclear testing. We’re in a better place today.


QUESTION: Could you tell us a little bit about your working relationship with the President, how often you have contact with him and the way that ebbs and flows between your department and his?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Sure. So I’ve been working for the President now for two years, first as the CIA director, now as the Secretary of State. And I talk to the President certainly every day. Oftentimes I see him more than once a day. We’re in frequent communication for – so that the State Department can execute America’s diplomatic mission around the world.


I met him really for the first time when he asked me to come interview to be the CIA director, and we’ve built a good working relationship since that day forward.


QUESTION: We’re talking with U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. Could you please characterize how things are going now with Iran?


SECRETARY POMPEO: The President took a very different approach with respect to Iran than President Obama had. We understand it to be the world’s largest state sponsor of terror, and truly a threat throughout the world through its proxy forces. And so we have begun a pressure campaign that has made clear to the Iranian people it’s not acceptable to commit assassination efforts in Europe, it’s not acceptable to continue to threaten Israel. Those are things that the previous administration had taken a very different approach, and we have put real pressure on Iran to change its behavior, and we’re working diligently to make sure that that happens in 2019.


QUESTION: Talking with U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. I’m going to ask a two-sided question: What is the best thing about your job as Secretary of State? And on the other side, what is the most challenging thing you have to deal with day after day?


SECRETARY POMPEO: So the second one’s easy. The biggest challenge is it is a complicated world. There remain actors all across the globe who want to take down America, the greatest nation in the history of civilization. They are determined to do so, and we need to be sure that we’re doing all that we can to prevent that so Americans can live their lives in safety and economic prosperity flows to our nation.


The best thing about the job is I literally get to go out around the world and meet with leaders and represent the United States of America. It is an enormous privilege. I get to tell them about Kansas and who I am and my background, to talk about why that set of values that America has is good for their country to be a partner with the United States.


QUESTION: Is there anything on the horizon coming up in 2019 that we really need to have our antenna up about?


SECRETARY POMPEO: So we all need to watch the threat that China poses to the United States over the long term. We see that Kansas businesses see it, where the Chinese misappropriate our property, steal our intellectual property. This is a real risk to the aviation industry that’s so important. It’s a challenge for our farmers to sell their products into China. Those are big, important issues, and things that matter to people in the heartland, and President Trump is committed to making those situations better for the American people.


QUESTION: All right. How do – would you characterize our relationship with China right now?


SECRETARY POMPEO: It’s a challenge. And we are working across multiple vectors, multiple ways to think about how we convince the Chinese to be – accept our products, allow us to sell products there, and stop stealing our stuff. It’s really pretty straightforward.


QUESTION: Has your life – your life has certainly taken a dramatic change over the course of the past year or two. Is it – do you enjoy the things you’re doing, and is it worthwhile for you? I think I know the answer.


SECRETARY POMPEO: It is, Ted. It’s been an incredible privilege. But I – I haven’t lost everything. I see that Ron Baker signed last night with the NBA team that is in the town that I live in now, and I can’t wait to go watch him play.


QUESTION: I think that’s a win-win for everybody.


SECRETARY POMPEO: It is; it’s good news.


QUESTION: Do you --


SECRETARY POMPEO: And I saw the Shocks play last night; I saw the second half. Good on them.


QUESTION: Do you help Ron with tickets, or does he hook you up with tickets? How does that work?


SECRETARY POMPEO: (Laughter.) I think if I said he helped me with tickets I would be committing a felony. So we’ll figure out how to make it work. We’ll – Susan and I will get a chance to go see him play before too long, I hope.


QUESTION: Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, we appreciate your time and we wish you and your family a Merry Christmas. Thanks for spending time with us here on KNSS.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Ted, thank you. Bless you. Have a Merry Christmas.


QUESTION: You as well. Thank you very much.

Today the United States Government announced historic action to confront the illegal immigration crisis facing the United States. We notified the Government of Mexico that the United States is invoking Section 235(b)(2)(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act. We will begin implementation immediately. Individuals arriving in the United States from Mexico—illegally or without proper documentation—will be returned to Mexico for the duration of their immigration proceedings. In response, the Mexican government has informed us that it will support the human rights of migrants by affording affected migrants humanitarian visas to stay on Mexican soil, the ability to apply for work, and other protections while they await U.S. proceedings.

The United States welcomes Bulgaria’s defense modernization plans and looks forward to the country’s imminent selection of a new multirole fighter aircraft.


As I emphasized during my phone call with Prime Minister Boyko Borissov on December 18, and as Deputy Secretary Sullivan underlined during his visit to Sofia last weekend, the United States is committed to working with the Bulgarian government to tailor the final scope of a potential F-16 sale to fit its budgetary and operational requirements, while still offering superior capabilities.


The United States has provided more than $200 million in security assistance to Bulgaria over the last 25 years to increase military professionalization and NATO interoperability. The United States has also invested more than $100 million in upgrades to the Novo Selo Training Center and Graf Ignatievo air base as part of the European Deterrence Initiative, and plans to continue such upgrades in the future. The United States will continue to prioritize investments with Bulgaria that build NATO interoperability.


The United States looks forward to completing final negotiations with the Bulgarian government.

SECRETARY POMPEO: Thank you all for being here with us today. Secretary Mattis and I are very pleased to welcome our Canadian counterparts, Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland and Minister of Defense Harjit Sajjan, to Washington. Welcome. It was a great day, and indeed, it was my honor to host this State Department 2+2 Strategic Dialogue, and it’s a great opportunity for us to have gotten some serious work done, but it’s also a discussion amongst friends.


The four of us have gotten to know each other quite well. We’ve achieved a lot together. Our meeting today comes after the historic signing of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, which was a tremendous victory for all three countries. I want to especially thank Minister Freeland for her efforts to make this happen. Look, the final deal is a home run. It modernizes NAFTA to address 21st century issues, 21st century economy, open trade and business, opportunities for United States farmers and manufacturers, reduce trade barriers amongst the three countries.


In today’s meeting, the four of us discussed how we can continue to build off of this, take this achievement and make progress on a worldwide range of bilateral and global issues. On the bilateral front, we discussed our joint efforts to ensure North America is vigorously protected by both our militaries in close cooperation with one another. We also had the chance to discuss our bilateral cooperation to promote economic security by countering technology transfers, intellectual property theft, and other attempts to acquire sensitive technology from our two countries. This will enhance security by ensuring our economic competitiveness and preserving our military capabilities. These joint efforts support a comprehensive trading relationship and millions of jobs in our two countries.


In addition to domestic priorities, we worked through a range of global issues as well. We talked about our work in collaboration as members of NATO. We discussed our response to the situation in Ukraine. I expressed my concern over Russia’s recent aggression in the Sea of Azov, where it rammed and opened fire on Ukrainian vessels. We also had the important opportunity to discuss our shared commitment to improving security in Iraq, where our nations have both made tremendous sacrifices in the name of freedom. I spoke, too, of the importance of applying pressure on the Iranian regime to stop its efforts to undermine Iraq’s democracy and security. It was great to talk about how we’ve worked closely together on North Korea, and I thank my Canadian counterparts for enforcing all of the UN Security Council resolutions and encouraging other countries to maintain pressure as well.


Of course, given the close relationship between the United States and Canada, disagreements will undoubtedly arise from time to time, but our countries have always worked closely together to resolve these challenges, including through regular and open dialogue like we’ve had had here today. I am very confident that as rough patches emerge, we’ll work through each of those challenges.


With that, I’d like to turn things over to Foreign Minister Freeland to make a few remarks, and then if you’d introduce Secretary Mattis, that’d be great.


FOREIGN MINISTER FREELAND: Okay. Thank you, Mike. Merci beaucoup. Bonjour, tout le monde. 


(Via interpreter) Hello, everyone, and thank you for being here. First of all, I would like to thank the Secretary of State Pompeo and the Secretary of Defense Mattis for their warm welcome today. Canada and the U.S. have one of the closest relationships in the whole entire world. We are allies and partners in areas such as trade, border protection, and of course, hemispheric defense and international security, especially through NATO and NORAD.


I would like to thank our hosts for giving us the opportunity to meet here today and to further discuss these topics as well as other issues of common interest for our two countries.


(In English) There are no closer partners in the world than Canada and the United States. We share the world’s longest undefended border and we are each other’s largest export market. Since the Second World War, we have worked side by side to build the rules-based international order and to fight for liberal democracy around the world.


This 2+2 meeting has been in the works for a while and it is a real pleasure to have been able to spend some time with our U.S. colleagues here in Washington to discuss our bilateral relationship and also some of the global challenges that we’re confronting together. As is always the case when we meet, we discussed a number of issues around foreign policy, defense, and international security that reflect the deeply shared values that unite our two countries. We discussed China and the case of Huawei CFO Meng Wanzhou, building on a conversation that Secretary Pompeo and I began soon after her arrest. We all agree that the most important thing we can do is to uphold the rule of law, ensure that Ms. Meng’s right to due process is respected, and that the current judicial process in Canada remains apolitical. We also discussed some consular issues, two which are very concerning for Canada today: the detention of Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor.


On Russia and Ukraine, Minister Sajjan and I expressed our condemnation of Russia’s harassment of shipping in the Sea of Azov and the Kerch Strait, and in particular its recent aggressive action towards an illegal seizure of three Ukrainian vessels on November 25th and the imprisonment of Ukrainian sailors. We call on Russia to release these sailors. Canada unwaveringly supports the people of Ukraine, its sovereignty, and territorial integrity within its internationally recognized borders.


We touched on some hemispheric issues, including the brutal authoritarian regime that is causing a dangerous crisis in Venezuela as well as troubling developments in Nicaragua. We took the opportunity to reiterate our support for the United States efforts towards a denuclearized Korean Peninsula and our efforts in the area of sanctions evasion.


In an ever-changing global landscape, it’s important that countries are able to nimbly respond to flagrant violations of the international order. An effective and targeted sanctions regime is key to this. Canada and the U.S. both have Magnitsky legislation, and we discussed ways to work together even more closely in this area. As a founding member of NATO, Canada will continue to do its part for transatlantic security and stability. My colleague, Minister Sajjan, Harj, will speak to some of the important work that we’re doing alongside the U.S. and NATO and as part of the Global Coalition to Defeat Daesh.


As Mike said, we spoke about our trading relationship, and we talked about the fact that we now have a modernized trade agreement for our continent. And I do agree with Mike that this is a good deal for all three countries.


I would be remiss if I didn’t mention the fact that Minister Sajjan and I did raise one of those difficult bilateral issues that Mike referred to: the U.S. imposition of steel and aluminum tariffs under Section 232. Canada continues to take the view that these tariffs are unjust and illegal, and we spoke to our partners about how the national security justification for these tariffs we believe is inconsistent with our close relationship. I met earlier today with Ambassador Lighthizer, and we also discussed the 232 tariffs this morning.


The close relationship between Canada and the United States is a model for integration and creative collaboration on the world stage, and today was a great opportunity to talk about how we can work even more closely together on our continent and around the world. I’d like to thank you again, Secretary Pompeo, Secretary Mattis, for hosting us. Canada deeply values and appreciates our partnership and opportunities to continue to work even more closely together.


And it is now my pleasure to introduce a tremendous public servant, a great friend of Canada, Secretary Mattis.


SECRETARY MATTIS: Well, thank you, Minister Freeland, and I echo Secretary Pompeo’s comment that ours was a discussion among friends. Minister Sajjan and I last saw one another just eight days ago in Ottawa, and today’s meeting signals how our two militaries work to stay closely aligned on a range of issues worldwide. For Americans feel an enduring, almost familiar kinship with Canada, and in my case it is familial. My mother’s family immigrated to America after my grandfather was wounded in action in World War I in the Canadian infantry.


Canadian and American forces have fought bravely alongside each other in the Great War, at Normandy, to Kandahar, Afghanistan following the 9/11 attack on our country. And today we continue our cooperation in pursuit of our mutual security. We are united in the North American Air Defense Command, where Canadian and U.S. fighters together guard the skies above North America and our 360 million people. We are united in NATO, where we uphold transatlantic unity and stand with European allies against the full scope of Russian malign influence, to include Moscow’s recent brazen contempt of international law in the Kerch Strait and action against the Ukrainian people.


Canadian and U.S. trainers in western Ukraine and our battalions in the Baltics represent our combined efforts to build stability and deter further provocative activity. Canada and the United States are united in security because we are united in democracy, and democracies stick together for the common defense. Today we focused on enhancing our already strong cooperation in a number of areas that you’ve heard about, from foreign military sales to sanctions coordination. Like Secretary Pompeo, I am grateful for Canada’s leadership enforcing unanimous UN Security Council resolutions on sanctions that support the denuclearization of North Korea.


Regarding the Middle East, we affirmed the need to continue the fight against ISIS’s hardened core and to maintain support to our partners in Iraq, an approach endorsed as well by 16 nations we met with last week in Ottawa. Accordingly, we are evolving our defeat ISIS coalition because we must not fall into complacency, recognizing that ISIS remains a strong terrorist enemy as it adapts to the crushing loss of its physical caliphate.


To close, last month Americans observed Veteran’s Day. Canada has Remembrance Day. But whatever the name, together we recalled our shared battlefield sacrifices and the many instances when the maple leaf and the stars and stripes have flown side by side against threats to our shared values. Come what may, I am confident Canada and the United States will continue to work shoulder to shoulder now and in the future.


Minister Sajjan, my friend, the floor is yours.


DEFENSE MINISTER SAJJAN: Great. Thank you, Secretary Mattis, and thank you, Secretary Pompeo for your being tremendous hosts. Secretary Mattis and I also share another mutual understanding, which is we’re both from the West Coast as well, which he reminded me of early on.


As my colleague Minister Freeland said, we have had a productive meeting to discuss our shared defense priorities. The United States is Canada’s most important ally and defense partner. Our relationship is longstanding, deeply entrenched, and multifaceted. It was – our relationship was forged on the battlefield fighting side by side. It is rooted in our shared geography, in our common values, in our historic connections, and in our highly integrated economies, and it is unique in its levels of integration and military-to-military cooperations at all levels and across the globe. The Canadian Armed Forces and the United States military stand shoulder to shoulder to protect and defend the continent of our citizens.


NORAD is the most notable example of this cooperation. We have been working together seamlessly for over 60 years since its inception to protect North America against current and future threats. Our militaries are highly interoperable. We are constantly learning from each other through our regional, continental, and international exercises. We provide collective transatlantic defense through NATO.


We are participating in multinational efforts to – also to enforce sanctions against North Korea. At the UN command in Korea, Canada is the second-largest contributor after the U.S. And earlier this year, General Eyre became the first Canadian to hold the post of deputy commander. And last week, as Secretary Mattis just said, Canada co-hosted the counter-ISIS ministerial meeting in Ottawa, and we discussed the next steps to ensure the lasting defeat of Daesh and its networks, and Canada remains committed to the coalition. This is evident through our Operation Impact and our leadership of the NATO training mission in Iraq.


As Minister Freeland mentioned, Canada also supports Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity in the face of Russian aggression. We have trained more than 10,000 Ukrainian soldiers as part of Operation Unifier, and at any given time we have about 800 – over 800 Canadian Armed Forces members deployed on Operation Reassurance, and they are supporting NATO deterrence measures in Eastern and Central Europe alongside our American allies. Canada is also leading NATO’s Enhanced Forward Presence Battle Group in Latvia, similar to the U.S. presence in Poland, and we have recently extended this mission by four years.


In the Asia-Pacific region Canada is engaged in Op Projection and working with the U.S. and other partners on regional security and defense cooperations.


And ladies and gentlemen, these are just a few examples of the depth and breadth of the Canada-U.S. defense partnership. Our cooperation offers both countries greater securities, and we will always remain strong allies and partners and even better friends.


Thank you.


MR PALLADINO: We now have time for a few questions. We would ask each reporter to please limit your question to one and no follow-ups, please. For the first question, I’d like to call on the BBC, Barbara Plett Usher.


QUESTION: A question to the Secretaries of State and Defense. Yesterday the Senate voted to withdraw troops from Yemen, or to end U.S. military involvement there I should say, and to unanimously censure Mohammed bin Salman as responsible for the Khashoggi killing. What is your response? What action will you take, and can you afford to ignore this?


And to the Canadian foreign minister, are you concerned that President Trump’s comments linking trade and the Huawei case suggest a perception that Canada is acting on the Americans’ behalf in a trade war? And are you worried that Canada is becoming collateral damage in what is a trade tension between China and the United States, because China has arrested Canadians, but on the other hand it has agreed to suspend tariffs on U.S. cars.


SECRETARY POMPEO: So perhaps I’ll begin. So we certainly saw the vote yesterday. We always have great respect for what the Legislative Branch does, and we are in constant contact with members on Capitol Hill so that we understand fully their concerns and do our level best to articulate why our policies are what they are and how we can ensure that we’re getting the right policy for the United States of America and to keep our country safe. And we’ll certainly do that in light of yesterday’s vote, and President Trump’s been very clear about the importance – not only importance of holding accountable those who murdered Jamal Khashoggi, but the importance of protecting American citizens.


There are hundreds of thousands of people that the Iranians killed and been involved in their deaths all across the Middle East. There’s real risk to the United States of America. You’ll recall that the Iranians and their explosive devices killed hundreds of American soldiers, and President Trump is determined to make sure that we protect America all the while holding accountable those who committed the heinous murder of Jamal Khashoggi.


SECRETARY MATTIS: I don’t want to repeat what the Secretary said. I’ll just add that besides that vote yesterday in the Senate, which we respect, there was also progress announced by the UN secretary-general in Stockholm to end the war, which required our engagement with all the parties and a strategic approach to ending that war that has gone on too long.


FOREIGN MINISTER FREELAND: Okay, when it comes to the case of the detention of Ms. Meng, Canada is a rule of law country. We believe in honoring our international treaty commitments and in respecting the rule of law and due process in our own country. In the case of Ms. Meng, due process and rule of law in Canada has been scrupulously followed. There has been no political interference in this process. It’s very important for Canada that Ms. Meng be treated with full respect and be given full access to due process in Canada, as she has been. She has currently been by the decision of a Canadian judge released on bail.


When it comes to the rule of law and due process in Canada, including in extradition matters, Canada understands that the rule of law and extradition issues ought not ever to be politicized or used as tools to resolve other issues, and that is the very clear position which Canada expresses to all of its partners. It’s a position which I have explained particularly with regard to rule of law in Canada in a conversation with the Chinese ambassador to Canada earlier this week, and it’s an issue which all of us discussed today.


And I do just finally want to say, because you’ve mentioned the two Canadians who are detained in China, it’s really important to remember these are human beings. As foreign minister, I think for me and for the prime minister there are no issues that touch us more personally and immediately than the detention of Canadians outside our country. We’re very, very seized of the issue. We’re very concerned about these two Canadians, and that is a concern that we discussed in our meeting today.


MODERATOR: (Speaking in French.)


QUESTION: (Via interpreter, in progress) Minister Freeland can answer in French and English after. Madam Freeland, do you have the impression currently that Canada is paying a heavy price for having been involved in this Huawei case and having charged the CFO of Huawei? And some of our citizens have been arrested in China. Do you have the impression that you are being used currently and we are being stuck between the United States and China in this trade war against your will and you are being used politically currently by the United States?


FOREIGN MINISTER FREELAND: (Via interpreter) I’m not in complete agreement with the question, the way it was phrased, because for Canada it was not – the detention of Ms. Meng was not a political decision on Canada’s part. It was a matter of following the rules. It’s a matter of obligations on the part of Canada to follow through with its obligations under international agreements. Canada follows the rule of law; Canada follows rules. It is very important, especially when there’s a lot of pressure on the very idea of democracy in the world, when there’s a lot of pressure on international order. Canada will thus continue to follow the rules. This is a strong position of our governments. By the same token, it is also very important for Canada that extradition agreements are not used for political purposes. Canada does not do it that way, and I believe that it is obvious that democratic countries such as our partner, the U.S., do the same.


Today we talked about our shared values, and one of them is the fact that both countries, the U.S. and Canada, are countries that follow the rule of law and follow rules in general.


(In English) I don’t entirely agree with the framing of the question. Canada in detaining Ms. Meng was not making a political judgment. In Canada, there has been, to this point, no political interference in this issue at all. For Canada, this is a question of living up to our international treaty obligations and following the rule of law in Canada, and that is something which has happened scrupulously. Canada is a rule-of-law country.


We discussed a little bit in our opening remarks how Canada and the United States are countries with deeply shared democratic values. Those democratic values include the fact that in both countries, we have a deep regard for the rule of law and strong and independent judiciaries. I think that’s one of the reasons that Canada and the United States, and both Canadians and Americans, feel comfortable with the existence of an extradition treaty between our two countries. And having said all of that, Canada is clearly of the view that extradition – the extradition process – is a criminal justice process. This is not a tool that should be used for politicized ends.


SECRETARY POMPEO: You didn’t ask me, but – and if I may, I’m just going to answer in English.


QUESTION: Oui, s’il (inaudible).


SECRETARY POMPEO: Thank you, thank you.


FOREIGN MINISTER FREELAND: I’d like to hear you try to do it in French. (Laughter.)


SECRETARY POMPEO: I can’t say much about the process because we have a U.S. judicial process that is underway, an extradition process that is underway. I can say this: The unlawful detention of two Canadian citizens is unacceptable. They ought to be returned. The United States has stood for that whether they’re our citizens or citizens of other countries. We ask all nations of the world to treat other citizens properly, and the detention of these two Canadian citizens in China ought to end.


MR PALLADINO: CNN, Elise Labott.


QUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Secretary. I’d like to follow up on your remarks just now. It does seem as if China is using these two – the detention of these two Canadian citizens – as kind of a bargaining chip on the trade talks between the U.S. and China. And I think the minister alluded to that when she suggested that these type of detentions are so concerning and shouldn’t be politicized. Do you think that’s what China’s doing here? And are you concerned that with President Trump’s suggestion that he might be willing to get involved in this other case of Ms. Meng in Canada, that that further puts Canada in a difficult situation and kind of puts Canada in the middle of your trade dispute with China? Thank you very much.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Yeah, I think that’s just the same question that was asked previously. I don’t see it that way. The United States is engaged in an extradition process. Ms. Meng travelled to Canada. The Canadians have taken her into custody, now released her on bail pending extradition, an extradition hearing. We’ll continue to engage through legal processes to get the just outcome that’s connected to that. We have a set of trade discussions that are ongoing with the Chinese. As the Chinese have said, we’re working on that while all the other issues – not just this particular issue, we have lots of complicated issues going on with China today all around the world. And we work on each of those to get good outcomes for the people of the United States of America and respecting the rule of law each step along the way. We’ll do that here as well.


MODERATOR: Next question. Adrian Morrow, Globe and Mail.


QUESTION: Thank you. Minister, it’s clear, it seems – sorry, Minister Freeland, it’s clear that these two Canadians were – appear to have been detained as a Chinese retaliation against the Huawei situation. Why won’t you sort of acknowledge that directly? And then as well, what is the – how was Michael Kovrig doing when our ambassador met with him in Beijing?


And Secretary Pompeo, is there anything that the U.S. is going to do to sort of lean on China to get them to release these people who have been detained, given that President Trump appears to have quite a good relationship with President Xi? Is there anything that you guys will do to sort of help Canada get these guys back?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Let me go first. Yeah, we’re going to work to get every citizen unlawfully detained all around the world returned to the country to which they have the very right to go back to. We do this in cases for our own people all the time. It’s something, as Chrystia said, weighs on those of us who serve to try and make sure that our citizens do have the opportunity to be returned home to their families. We always believe in that, we’ll always work on it, and we’ll do it in this case as well.


FOREIGN MINISTER FREELAND: Thank you for that, Mike. So Adrian, I have spoken this week with the Chinese ambassador to Canada and we’ve had many contacts with Chinese authorities. Chinese officials in their contact with Canada have not drawn a connection between these different issues.


From Canada’s perspective, these kinds of issues ought never to be confused with one another. In the detention of Ms. Meng, Canada was, as I’ve said, acting scrupulously in line with our treaty commitments and in line with the rule of law. And as Mike has said, the next step while Ms. Meng is on bail in Vancouver is for a Canadian court and Canadian judges to rule on whether the extradition is warranted or not.


Of course, Canadian citizen – we will always advocate strongly and fiercely for Canadian citizens when they are detained abroad. In the cases of Mr. Korvig and Mr. Spavor, our immediate concern has been to gain consular access to them and to understand what the charges are being put on them by the Chinese authorities, and we are seeking that – we’re advocating for them very, very aggressively.


Ambassador McCallum was able now to see and speak with and meet with Mr. Kovrig and we’re glad that that could happen. I’ve spoken also to family members of both men, and I just want to say and reassure all Canadians, but especially the family and friends of Mr. Kovrig, Mr. Spavor, this is a huge priority for our government. We are extremely seized of this issue. We care for, we fight for all Canadians detained abroad, and actually, as Mike said, all people unfairly detained abroad, but specifically we have a specific duty of care to Canadians, and we fight for everybody. Mr. Kovrig is also an employee of my department, he’s well known to many Canadian diplomats, and that makes it especially personal for us.


QUESTION: (Off-mike.)


FOREIGN MINISTER FREELAND: You know what? I’m going to let – I’m going to respect his privacy and the privacy of his family. We’ve shared with his family details of the meeting.


MR PALLADINO: Thank you all for attending today. That concludes our press conference.

The United States commends participants from the Yemen consultations in Sweden for making progress on key initiatives, including a cease-fire and withdrawal of forces in Hudaydah, prisoner exchanges, and opening humanitarian corridors to the city of Taiz. Although many details remain subject to further discussion, these consultations between the Republic of Yemen Government and the Houthis marked a pivotal first step. All parties have an opportunity to build upon this momentum and improve the lives of all Yemenis. Moving forward, all must continue to engage, de-escalate tensions, and cease ongoing hostilities. This is the best way to give these and future consultations a chance to succeed. The United States thanks UN Special Envoy Martin Griffiths for his leadership on these efforts, continued optimism, and ability to inspire reconciliation. We also thank the Government of Sweden for hosting, as well as the governments of Kuwait, Oman, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and the many others that helped facilitate and support the consultations. The work ahead will not be easy, but we have seen what many considered improbable begin to take shape. Peace is possible. The end of these consultations can be the beginning of a new chapter for Yemen.

QUESTION: Let’s bring in Mike Pompeo, the U.S. Secretary of State. Thank you so much for being here with us.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Ainsley, it’s great to be with you all.


QUESTION: We have so many topics to get through with you. First of all, what’s your reaction to this?


SECRETARY POMPEO: So it’s obviously tragic. The loss of life is always awful. But these risks of terror, we all need to be mindful, they’re everywhere. Europe has got an enormous challenge. The United States tries our best to help them. We try to keep Americans safe when they’re traveling over this holiday season. This was a Christmas market. This appears to have been attacked because it was a Christmas market, although the facts are still developing. These are real risks all around the world and we can – we must always be mindful that America has a big role in preventing terror around the world.


QUESTION: No Americans killed?


SECRETARY POMPEO: It appears there were no Americans killed or injured, but we still don’t have all the facts just yet.


QUESTION: Sure. Apparently he was on a terror watch list. The police were going to arrest him before he started shooting. They got to his house and he wasn’t there, so they were unable to arrest him. He was on a terror watch list, though, and some – we had an expert on this morning about an hour ago who said why have a terror watch list if we can’t keep an eye on people.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Yeah, Steve. This is an enormous challenge. We have this problem here in the United States as well. Lots of folks that we’re watching we think are a risk we try to monitor, but the numbers are so big. It’s why, frankly, border security matters too. These are related issues in the sense of we need to know who’s coming in and out of our country so there are fewer people that the FBI and sheriff’s offices in Kansas and places like that have to monitor and watch. Every time we add to people here who have the risk of becoming radicalized, we increase the risk to American citizens.


QUESTION: Yeah, I know you’re in contact – as we switch over to immigration – with the new president of Mexico and I know you’re going to be heading there shortly. What is their role, do you think, on their southern border to protect our southern border? Do you see that they – do they see an urgency now that perhaps they haven’t sensed before?


SECRETARY POMPEO: The incoming administration’s been great. They’ve now been in power for less than two weeks. But our conversations about how it is we control traffic flow into Mexico along their southern border from Guatemala, from Honduras --


QUESTION: What we saw was a joke. They let rocks dissuade them from stopping caravans.


SECRETARY POMPEO: We have to control that border that is ours and they have to control that border that is theirs. And we’re happy to support them, we’re happy to try and do the things we can do to help them, but this is a real national security issue for the United States of America, so it shouldn’t surprise you that the State Department is involved in trying to make sure that we do what the President has said, which is to have control over our southern border.


QUESTION: Sure. Well, the President yesterday – I’m sure you saw the President’s contentious meeting in the Oval Office with Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer. They said we don’t need the wall. The President said I’m willing to shut down the government over this wall thing. What do you say? You used to be in Congress.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Yeah. The Democrats have been all over on this issue when I was a member of Congress. Now I try to step away from the domestic U.S. politics, but this much is sure: We have to have the capacity to control entry into our country everywhere – through our airports and ports, but most importantly today at the southern border, and a wall is a vital component of that, and we ought to build it out.


QUESTION: Nancy Pelosi said yesterday we don’t need it.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Yeah.


QUESTION: Experts say we don’t need.


SECRETARY POMPEO: We should build it out. We should do all the things we need to do to control the flow of people into our country in a way that is lawful only.


QUESTION: Mr. Secretary, there’s no doubt about it if – see, most of the people coming here illegally are not Mexicans, OTMs. So if Mexico sees the same problem, is there a chance they’ll pay for this wall? Have you had initial conversations about this?


SECRETARY POMPEO: So we’re working in the State Department on lots of issues not directly related to the wall. There are lots of things the Mexican Government can do to discourage this transit from these three Northern Triangle countries. And I think back to my time in Kansas. There’s a big highway that runs out of Mexico. We used to have a lot of illegal traffic come up that very highway. There are many components to this. A border wall and a security system is certainly one of them. But frankly, the most important thing we can do is turn off the flow from those three countries and reduce the risk to our Customs and Border Patrol agents, our ICE agents, the men and women who are tasked with apprehending these folks who have transited into our country illegally.


QUESTION: Let’s talk about the murder of Jamal Khashoggi. The President doubled down on his support of the Saudi crown prince, said he’s a good ally. You have some senators that are calling for more action. They want condemnation; they want him to be penalized. You’re going to be briefing the House today. What do you plan on saying?


SECRETARY POMPEO: So we’re going to say to the House what we’ve said to the American people. President Trump’s made very clear: The murder of Jamal Khashoggi was a tragic incident; it was heinous. It’s not something that America approves of. We’ve already held a number of individuals accountable by putting sanctions on them, those that we have evidence were directly involved. We’ll continue to develop the facts, but America has an important ally in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. They work with us on issues that provide security for America and for Israel. It is an important relationship with the kingdom and we intend to continue to protect the American people in the way that voters back two years ago demanded.


QUESTION: Right. But Mr. Secretary, they’re the ones who are putting it in peril, not us. They’re the ones who have evidently pulled this off. And when you have people like Lindsey Graham, hardly an enemy of the White House, and Bob Corker and others said this is a “smoking saw,” not a “smoking gun,” and you even have audio tapes, we know the prince knows, right? You know, you looked him in the eye. You know that he knows.


SECRETARY POMPEO: I’ve spoken to the king, King Salman. I’ve spoken to the crown prince a number of times since the murder of Jamal Khashoggi, and it is absolutely America’s intent to hold everyone accountable who was responsible for this.


QUESTION: So that’s yes, you – when you looked him in the eye and he denied it, did you believe him?


SECRETARY POMPEO: The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia decides who’s running the country. I think this is what the President said yesterday. We are working closely with the kingdom to make sure that America is protected. That’s our interest there.


QUESTION: What’s your response? The CIA says that they’re highly confident that the Saudi crown prince did order the murder of Khashoggi.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Yeah, some of the reporting that you’ve seen on that has been inaccurate.


QUESTION: Is that part – is that inaccurate?


QUESTION: That’s false?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Look, we all know they’re still working on this. This is still a developing set of facts with respect to the murder of Jamal Khashoggi. The intelligence community is working diligently on that. The direct evidence – this is what I’ve said before – the direct evidence isn’t yet available. It may show up tomorrow; it may have shown up overnight and I haven’t seen it. But President Trump is – President Trump --


QUESTION: Someone has to pay the price, though. It’s so brutal. Apparently, those audio tapes are awful.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Well, we – the Saudis have already paid the price. There are the folks who actually committed the murder we’ve held accountable. We will continue to do that. No one underestimates how horrible this murder was, but remember, Iran is running rampant throughout the Middle East. The death of any one individual is awful. The death of hundreds of thousands of people in Europe or the Middle East or the United States matters an awful lot, and President Trump is committed to protecting America.


QUESTION: Well it’s a big story. That’s why Time Magazine made murdered journalists the cover story for Man of the Year, People of the Year.


Let’s talk a little bit about China. We know that the President has tried to equalize the whole tariff situation between us and them, and the stock market has gone up and down and up and down. I know that there are other people negotiating the trade deals and the tariff stuff as well, but what’s your involvement in that? Because right now, it looks to some from the outside like maybe we’re not on good terms with China.


SECRETARY POMPEO: So our relationship with China is a challenging one to be sure. We consider them a strategic competitor. They are taking actions in the South China Sea. They’re conducting espionage and influence operations here in the United States.


QUESTION: The latest one was the Marriott.


SECRETARY POMPEO: That’s right.


QUESTION: 500 million guests there have been – had their security breached.


SECRETARY POMPEO: They have committed cyber attacks across the world. Our effort, from Department of Homeland Security and the FBI and the State Department, is to push back against these threats to America from China. Trade is a component of that to be sure. The President is very focused on making sure Americans get a chance to sell their products into China. It’s a big market, and the President is determined to get a level playing field for American businesses.


QUESTION: Are we closer? Are we closer to a deal?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Yeah, I think we’re closer. I truly think we’re closer, and I’m very hopeful in the next handful of weeks there’ll be some good announcements on that front.


QUESTION: This Huawei executive, the President says, “I might have to get directly involved if it hurts our trade negotiations.” That that would be him going into the law enforcement end where there’s a trade end. Do you worry about the President blending the two?


SECRETARY POMPEO: We always have to balance American interests. Any time there’s a law enforcement engagement, we need to make sure we take foreign policy consideration – considerations into effect. It’s totally appropriate to do so. The President’s mission is very clear. It’s “America First,” right? Making sure that we protect the American people from threats, whether they emanate from Russia or from China or from any of the other places we’ve had the chance to talk about this morning.


QUESTION: Let’s talk about your speech in Brussels – bold, unconventional. Was your message heard?


SECRETARY POMPEO: I think so. We’ve gotten lots of feedback from it to be sure.


QUESTION: Such as?


SECRETARY POMPEO: I’m not sure unconventional is accurate, but we told hard truths about the things that America intends to do. There’s this notion somehow that we’ve withdrawn from American leadership, and nothing could be further from the truth. President Trump has boldly reasserted American leadership. But where organizations that no longer function in the way they should have, right – if there’s inadequate burden-sharing at NATO, if the UN is acting in a way that is against Israel, we’re going to call it out in this administration.


QUESTION: But they don’t – the world doesn’t like the whole “America First” message. They like the world first.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Yeah. We’re committed to leading in America. We want them to assert their own sovereignty as well. We want those leaders of their countries to protect their people too, and we think together that will create peace and prosperity for the world.


QUESTION: You’re the chief diplomat, but it’s obviously the thuggish behavior of the Russians with the Ukrainians, taking three ships and 24 sailors. Nothing’s budged. What could we actually do in coordination with Defense to stop the aggression from Georgia to the Ukraine? It’s not ceasing and bombers now in Venezuela. How urgent is this and how can an economy that’s shrinking like this act as boldly as that?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Sometimes the last act doesn’t appear to be the last act, and deterrence is just on the horizon. We have pushed back against Russia in serious ways. We’ve provided defensive weapon systems for the Ukrainians to defend their own country. We have sanctioned more Russians than any administration in recent history. This administration has been very serious. We’ve obviously seen these incidents in the Kerch Strait, and we’re working with our European partners, for whom this is in their backyard and presents a real short-term risk, to make sure they understand the importance of protecting that waterway and pushing back against the Russians in a way that actually leads to deterrence from this kind of aggression from Vladimir Putin.


QUESTION: Well, Mr. Secretary, we know you’ve been doing a lot of traveling all over the world since you got the got the job.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Yes, sir.


QUESTION: Thanks for dropping by the couch.


SECRETARY POMPEO: It’s great to be with you all.


QUESTION: Good to see you, Mr. Secretary.


QUESTION: Thank you so much. Great to see you. Wish you all the best today.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Brian, wonderful to see you too, sir. Wonderful to see you. Thank you.


QUESTION: Congratulations on everything. Thank you.


QUESTION: And Merry Christmas.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Thank you. Merry Christmas, Steve.

SECRETARY POMPEO: Good afternoon, everyone. We had a productive Security Council meeting where the United States made clear that Iran’s ballistic missile activity is out of control and that they are defying the UN Security Council 2231 in numerous ways. 


Iran has been testing – on a testing spree and a proliferation spree and this must come to an end. We want to work with all members of the Security Council to reimpose tougher restrictions on the Iranian ballistic missiles. The restrictions that were in place under UNSCR 1929 are the place that the world needs to be today. This threat is real and upon us. We clearly see that the JCPOA didn’t succeed in stopping this malign activity. This Security Council has a responsibility to protect citizens in the Middle East, Americans traveling through the Middle East, Europeans who are now at risk from Iranian missiles, and we called upon every member of the Security Council to undertake actions that would achieve that.


With that, I’m happy to take a couple of questions.


MR PALLADINO: Let’s start with CBS, Pam Falk.


QUESTION: Thank you. Thank you very much, Mr. Secretary. It’s Pamela Falk from CBS. Do you envision any additional sanctions on either Iran or on the European Union given the fact that the SPV, according to Iran’s chief of staff of the president, is about to go into effect in two or three weeks, meaning avoiding U.S. sanctions given what you said today about the proliferation?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Sure. So I never get out in front of decisions that we make about sanctions. We have to evaluate the facts as they present themselves. But we’ve been unambiguous with respect to those things that are permissible and those that are not. Should it be the case that the Europeans develop an SPV, we’ll look at it. There are humanitarian exemptions in the sanctions that have been put in place for foodstuffs and medicine. If the activity that is undertaken is consistent with that, we obviously won’t emplace sanctions. But to the extent that there are violations of our sanctions, we intend to enforce them with great rigor against any party who is a participant in those violations.


MR PALLADINO: (Inaudible) BBC.


QUESTION: Right here. Right here. Thank you, Secretary. BBC. Good afternoon.


SECRETARY POMPEO: (Off-mike.)


QUESTION: Secretary, you heard your European allies expressing their continued support for JCPOA. You also – even the French ambassador talking about how pressure and sanctions might not change a dynamic much alone. If you’re here exactly where we are one year from now, another 2231 meeting where your sanctions haven’t changed the behavior of the Iranian regime, they are still adhering to the deal, and their missile activity or regional activity is (inaudible) less as where we are, what is next? I ask that because Mr. Hook standing here just two weeks ago talked about military option, and many of your critics are saying you’re basically repeating the Iraq playbook and that this is all a pretense for war. What is the next step if your sanctions do not work a year from now?


SECRETARY POMPEO: So back to first principles. The first thing that didn’t work was the JCPOA. All the ballistic missile activity, save for the last two that I spoke about today, occurred during the JCPOA. So if you’re looking for an agreement that was unable to contain assassination efforts in Europe, the establishment of an equivalent of Lebanese Hizballah on the cusp of being achieved in Yemen, malign activity in Iraq by the Iranians, the missile activity to which we were debating today – if you’re looking for bad activity, this all occurred during the JCPOA. So if you’re looking for a failed agreement, I got a good one for you.


Now it’s time for this Security Council to get serious about this real risk from proliferation from the Iranian regime. And it is our determination to do everything we can, everything within – as the President says, everything we can to make sure that we do the right thing. We’re going to exert American leadership to build a coalition – and you heard today, you heard 11 members of the Security Council join the United States in expressing their concerns about the Iranian missile proliferation. We’re going to work with a coalition to build out a set of responses that deliver deterrence against Iran and its continued proliferation of ballistic missiles and ballistic missile systems that have the potential to carry nuclear warheads.


MR PALLADINO: Fox News, Adam Shaw, please.


QUESTION: Mr. Secretary, Adam Shaw, Fox News. We saw a lot of support for the JCPOA from the European countries today. We also saw a lot of criticism of Iran’s destabilizing activities. Are you getting any sense that European countries are beginning to come around to your way of thinking on Iran?


SECRETARY POMPEO: So I’ll let the European countries speak for themselves with respect to where they are, but this much is clear: We have a different view on the JCPOA, as we should – or we’re not ambiguous when I speak with my European counterparts. We’re very clear about that. They view it as the linchpin. I view it as a disaster and I think President Trump does as well.


Now the challenge is this: We continue to see the Islamic Republic of Iran behaving in ways that are inconsistent with keeping people safe all around the world, and we need to figure out how together we can build out a coalition to push back against that. There are lots of places that can occur. It can occur while the JCPOA is still in effect, that is, while they’re still inside of it. But make no mistake, American leadership is determined to work not only with the Europeans – we think of Germany, France, and Britain, but many other European countries who share our concerns as well, countries throughout the Middle East, Asia, Africa all joining with the United States under our leadership to – first, as a first step, acknowledge the risk that Iran presents and then set up a response that will ultimately deter them.


MR PALLADINO: Last question. Al Jazeera, James Bays.


QUESTION: Mr. Secretary, James Bays from Al Jazeera.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Yes, sir.


QUESTION: You were today in the chair that’s normally occupied by Ambassador Haley. She said in an interview the – about responsibility for the death of Jamal Khashoggi, she said, “It was the Saudi Government, and MBS is the head of the Saudi Government. So they are all responsible and they don’t get a pass.” Do you agree that Mohammed bin Salman is responsible?


SECRETARY POMPEO: So I think Ambassador Haley said something that’s very consistent with what President Trump and I have both said, which is that we have already held accountable a large number of persons who were responsible for the heinous murder of Jamal Khashoggi, that we will continue to investigate and take the facts where they lead, and get to a place where we hold those responsible accountable. We’ll do that. 


At the same time, and I didn’t hear these remarks by Ambassador Haley, but I’m confident that she would share my view that America’s interests in the region are important. And our partnership with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is an important one. It has delivered American security in important ways in President Trump’s first two years in office, and we intend to continue to work with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to keep America safe.


QUESTION: (Inaudible.)


SECRETARY POMPEO: Thank you all.

SECRETARY POMPEO: Thank you very much, and good morning. Thank you for the kind words. I appreciate them.


Just two days ago, the head of the IRGC’s airspace division, Amir Hajizadeh, boasted that Iran is capable of building missiles with a range beyond 2,000 kilometers. He said, quote, “We have the ability to build missiles with broader ranges. We don’t have limitations from a technical perspective.” End of quote. He also said there are many “enemy bases” within 800 kilometers of Iran – in other words, within striking distance of Iranian missiles. He bragged that Iran does 40 to 50 tests per year.


As I’ll talk about further, it is clear that the Iranian regime’s ballistic missile activity has grown since the nuclear deal. Iran has exploited the goodwill of nations and defied multiple Security Council resolutions in its quest for a robust ballistic missile force. The United States will never stand for this.


No nation that seeks peace and prosperity in the Middle East should either.


Since 2006, this Council has been telling Iran to stop testing and proliferating ballistic missiles in one form or another. From 2010 to 2015, Iran was subject to UN Security Council Resolution 1929 – the strictest resolution addressing the Iranian ballistic missiles to date.


In that resolution, the Security Council decided that, “Iran shall not undertake any activity related to ballistic missiles capable of delivering nuclear weapons, including launches using ballistic missile technology, and that States shall take… necessary measures to prevent the transfer of technology or technical assistance to Iran related to such activities.” This provision of UNSCR 1929 imposed a legal prohibition on Iran’s ballistic missile activity. There was force of law behind these words.


Nevertheless, Iran conducted multiple ballistic missile launches between 2010 and 2015, in flagrant violation of that resolution.


So what did we do in response? Did we increase accountability on Iran for serial violations of international law? Quite the opposite. In fact, the level of accountability on Iran has diminished instead of -- decreased, while the risk has increased.


In connection with the Iranian regime’s engagement in nuclear talks, and at the Obama administration’s urging, the Security Council replaced Resolution 1929 with Resolution 2231. Resolution 2231 “calls upon” Iran not to undertake any activity related to ballistic missiles designed to be capable of delivering nuclear weapons. Notwithstanding that change in language, the world’s concerns remain.


When we collectively “call upon” Iran to cease its ballistic missile activity, we must agree to stop it now. But Iran is as defiant of the world’s insistence as ever. Because here we are, for the 12th year in a row, meeting about Iran’s ballistic missiles, addressing an incredibly problematic data set.


Iran’s pace of missile activity, including missile launches and tests, did not diminish since the JCPOA. In fact, Iran’s missile testing and missile proliferation is growing. Today Iran has the largest ballistic missile force in the Middle East. It has more than 10 ballistic missile systems in its inventory or in development. It has hundreds of missiles which pose a threat to our partners in the region.


From more recent times: In 2016, during the time of the JCPOA, Iran unveiled two new short-range ballistic missiles, which it claims are capable of striking targets between 500 and 700 kilometers. In January of 2017, during the time of the JCPOA, Iran launched a medium-range missile designed to carry a payload greater than 500 kilograms, and which could be used to carry nuclear warheads. Its suspected range also approaches 2,000 kilometers, which is far enough to target Athens, Sofia, Bucharest, and other major European cities. If the IRGC airspace commander is telling the truth, and Iran has capabilities beyond 2,000 kilometers, other European capitals are at risk as well.


In July of 2017, while the United States was still in the JCPOA, Iran tested a Simorgh space launch vehicle. The United States, France, Germany, and the UK all assessed that the launch was inconsistent with 2231, because space launch vehicle use – uses a similar technology as intercontinental ballistic missiles.


Iran has exported ballistic missile systems as well, most recently to Yemen. We have hard evidence that Iran is providing missiles, training, and support to the Houthis, and the Iranian-Houthi missile force is fully engaged. This poses a threat to innocent civilians – including Americans – living in Riyadh, Abu Dhabi, Dubai, as well as people of all nationalities who travel on civilian aircraft in that region.


Iran is also transferring ballistic missile systems to Shia militias in Iraq.


And just look at the last two weeks. The Iranian regime test-fired a medium range ballistic missile that is capable of carrying multiple warheads.


Our goodwill gestures have been futile, futile in correcting the Iranian regime’s reckless missile activity and its destructive behaviors. No nation can dispute that Iran is in open defiance of UN Security Council Resolution 2231.


The United States is not alone in raising these concerns. I’d like to thank France and Germany and the United Kingdom for raising concerns about Iranian missile proliferation to the secretariat.


I would also like to thank our partners from Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, who are working with UN inspectors in recovering material debris of Iranian-supplied missiles, rockets, and UAVs launched into their countries by Houthi forces in Yemen.


Our Israeli allies have brought further evidence to the Security Council about Iran’s continued launches of ballistic missiles that are inherently capable of carrying nuclear weapons. Israel has also given evidence to the secretariat of Iran’s transfer of weapon systems to its proxies all around the Middle East, and in defiance of what we have insisted that they do.


So the question – the question now: What steps ought we take to confront this Iranian malign activity? We risk the security of our people if Iran continues stocking up on ballistic missiles. We risk escalation of conflict in the region if we fail to restore deterrence. And we convey to all other malign actors that they too can defy the Security Council with impunity if we do nothing.


The United Nations Charter, as you all know well, calls the primary – gives – bestows upon the Security Council “the primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security.” We all take this responsibility seriously. The United States seeks to work with all other members of the Council to reimpose on Iran the ballistic missiles restrictions outlined in 1929.


Beyond addressing Iran’s ballistic missile activities, the Council should not lift the arms embargo in 2020 on Iran. This is a country in noncompliance with multiple UN Security Council resolutions, including those related to al-Qaida, Afghanistan, Lebanon, Yemen, and Somalia. Iran is harboring al-Qaida, supporting Taliban militants in Afghanistan, arming terrorists in Lebanon, facilitating illicit trade in Somali charcoal benefiting al-Shabaab, and training and equipping Shia militias in Iraq, even as we sit here today.


It is also stoking conflict in Syria and Yemen. The Council must address these malign activities. It cannot reward Iran by lifting the arms embargo.


We also call on the Council to establish inspection and interdiction measures, in ports and on the high seas, to thwart Iran’s continuing efforts to circumvent the existing arms restrictions.


Some have questioned our decision to withdraw from the JCPOA. We reply that it is self-evident why we did so based upon the very conversation we’re having here today. Prior to the deal, Western leaders made grand claims of how the JCPOA would usher in a new era of moderation from the Iranian regime.


Indeed, America’s own president said, quote, “Ideally, we would see a situation in which Iran, seeing sanctions reduced, would start focusing on its economy, on training its people, on re-entering the world community, to lessening its provocative activities in the region.” But what do we actually see?


The JCPOA has without a doubt, to date, shielded the Islamic Republic of Iran from the accountability to the risks it presents to the world.


The Iranian regime is pursuing the same destructive, revolutionary goals that it has for the past 39 years – except now it has more money to achieve them, thanks to the nuclear deal.


I’m here today first and foremost as my capacity as the Secretary of State of the United States of America. Under President Trump, the security of our people and our allies comes first.


But in the finest traditions of American leadership, the United States will continue to unite sovereign nations in their responsibility to work for the peace and security of their own people and a stable international order.


The United States is going to continue to be relentless in building a coalition of responsible nations who are serious in confronting the Iranian regime’s reckless ballistic missile activity.


This includes the treatment of its own people as well. That type of malign activity is something that the United States will keep standing side by side with the people of Iran. They have been the worst victims of the regime for nearly 40 years and they have the unwavering support of the United States.


Finally, The Trump administration clearly defined in May the 12 areas in which we are demanding change from Iran.


If Iran makes a fundamental strategic shift and honors these demands, we are prepared to ease our pressure campaign and support the modernization and reintegration of the Iranian economy into the international economic system.


But relief – relief from our efforts will come only when we see tangible, demonstrated, and sustained shifts in Tehran’s policies.


Thank you.

On November 28, 2018, I designated Burma, China, Eritrea, Iran, North Korea, Pakistan, Sudan, Saudi Arabia, Tajikistan, and Turkmenistan, as Countries of Particular Concern under the International Religious Freedom Act of 1998 for having engaged in or tolerated ”systematic, ongoing, [and] egregious violations of religious freedom.” I also placed Comoros, Russia, and Uzbekistan on a Special Watch List for governments that have engaged in or tolerated “severe violations of religious freedom.” Finally, I designated al-Nusra Front, al-Qa’ida in the Arabian Peninsula, al-Qa'ida, al-Shabab, Boko Haram, the Houthis, ISIS, ISIS-Khorasan, and the Taliban as Entities of Particular Concern.


In far too many places across the globe, individuals continue to face harassment, arrests, or even death for simply living their lives in accordance with their beliefs. The United States will not stand by as spectators in the face of such oppression. Protecting and promoting international religious freedom is a top foreign policy priority of the Trump Administration. In July, I hosted the first-ever Ministerial to Advance Religious Freedom, which brought together some 85 likeminded governments and more than 400 civil society organizations to harness global attention and motivate forceful action to advance respect for the human right of religious freedom.


Safeguarding religious freedom is vital to ensuring peace, stability, and prosperity. These designations are aimed at improving the lives of individuals and the broader success of their societies. I recognize that several designated countries are working to improve their respect for religious freedom; I welcome such initiatives and look forward to continuing the dialogue.


The United States remains committed to working with governments, civil society organizations, and religious leaders to advance religious freedom around the world.

Seventy years ago, the UN General Assembly adopted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Emerging from a world war that shocked humanity with its cruelty, the sovereign nations of the world united to specify those rights that are inherent to all persons, and committed to their promotion and protection henceforth.


The Declaration’s fundamental principles remain as relevant today as they were seventy years ago. Still, governments impede the freedoms of religion or belief and expression. Citizens’ rights to participate in free, fair, and genuine elections remain precarious. Authorities continue to subject prisoners to torture and inhumane treatment. Global recognition of the inalienable rights belonging to all individuals must be continually encouraged and reaffirmed.


U.S. foreign policy is rooted in the understanding that governments that respect individual rights and fundamental freedoms remain the best vehicles for prosperity, stability, and peace. On this International Human Rights Day, the United States underscores its commitment to promoting human freedom at home and around the world.

QUESTION: Welcome back, America. It’s Hugh Hewitt, joined now by the United States Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo. Merry Christmas, Mr. Secretary. Thank you for joining me this morning.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Good morning, Hugh. Merry Christmas to you as well, sir.


QUESTION: I want to say first of all last week when you were in Europe, one of your predecessors at the CIA passed away. We’ve heard a lot about President George Herbert Walker Bush as vice president and as president, but what did you know of H.W. as it was reflected at Langley where you led?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Boy, it was – he is widely revered there. My first encounter was – I was a soldier that served. I patrolled the very wall, the border that he brought down when I was a young soldier back in the late 1980s. He was my commander-in-chief, and then I had the chance to get to know him a little bit when I was the CIA director. He was most generous with his time and his thoughts about how to make that institution instructive, powerful, and useful to the president of the United States, and to make it work well on behalf of the American people. He was a gentleman, he was generous, and I always enjoyed my conversations with him.


QUESTION: A lot of people said going to the CIA would render him ineligible for the presidency, but do you think generally being the director of the CIA is good preparation for being in the top job?


SECRETARY POMPEO: I think being the director of the CIA gives you insights into the way the world really works on the ground in some of the most difficult parts of the country, and I think that background served President Bush very well as he moved into his role as commander-in-chief.


QUESTION: Now, Mr. Secretary, Heather Nauert has served you so wonderfully well, and congratulations to her going to the UN, but here’s my question about the UN: On Friday, that body failed to officially condemn Hamas. How much good can even a great appointee like Heather do when a body is that dense?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Boy, it’s a fair question, but it matters. It matters who we have there representing us for sure, and I look forward to Heather’s confirmation. I think she’ll do wonderful work for the State Department and for the United States and for the president. Your point about Friday afternoon is consistent with the points that I made when I spoke – goodness, it’s now been a week on – back in Brussels. These institutions don’t work the way they were originally intended to work. They now have been in some cases hijacked by bad actors, and President Trump’s leadership in the world is aimed at taking these institutions and making sure that they are fit for purpose, that they still continue to serve their original ends. The UN is a prime example of that.


QUESTION: Now I want to come to the Brussels speech because I think it was significant, and in the funeral of H.W. Bush it was lost a little bit. Before I do, the breaking news is that Prime Minister May has canceled the Commons vote tomorrow on Brexit. If there is a hard Brexit, Mr. Secretary, do you think the United States can quickly get a free trade deal done with our oldest ally to ease the transition to an outside-of-the-EU UK?


SECRETARY POMPEO: There’s a long history of our two countries working incredibly close together across every front of our relationship, certainly trade included amongst them. If there’s a hard Brexit, I remain very confident the United States and the United Kingdom will continue to have a special relationship. It matters certainly to them, but it matters a great deal to us as well.


QUESTION: While you were in Brussels you received a surprise visit from Prime Minister Netanyahu of Israel to talk to you about Operation Northern Shield. Have you indicated – has President Trump indicated – full support for Operation Northern Shield, which is designed to stop Hizballah from using tunnels, along with the IRGC from Iran, to invade Israel?


SECRETARY POMPEO: The United States fully supports Israel’s right and we do our best to support their capability to defend themselves from Iranian aggression. These tunnels are Iranian-connected Lebanese Hizballah efforts to violate the most basic premise of sovereignty, of national sovereignty, that is, digging tunnels onto someone’s terrain. And so we support Israel’s right to defend itself, including the exercises on the Israeli side of the border that they now are calling Northern Shield.


QUESTION: Now I’ve got to say, your speech in Brussels last week would have been earth-shaking had it not been for George Herbert Walker Bush’s funeral. I quote, as you announced the withdrawal of the United States in 60 days from the INF Treaty: “These violations of the INF Treaty cannot be viewed in isolation from the larger pattern of Russian lawlessness on the world stage. The list of Russia’s infamous acts is long: Georgia, Ukraine, Syria, election meddling, Skripal, and now the Kerch Strait, to just name a few.”


Mr. Secretary, that is the greatest brushback of Russia since Reagan in Berlin. Did you get any reaction from Mr. Putin to that?


SECRETARY POMPEO: They didn’t think we had it quite right, which gives me great confidence that, in fact, we did get it right. Look, what I was intending to do there was articulate President Trump’s efforts around the world to continue the tradition of American leadership, to keep the world prosperous and the people around the world secure. It is a model that depends on national sovereignty and depends on calling things out when they no longer make sense. So the INF Treaty is but one example. It was formed in the late 1980s. It may well have made sense then, but it no longer made sense for America to be the only party to that treaty that was complying with it, and it no longer made sense, not only for America but for Europe and the world. And so we’re fully engaged in doing everything we can. We want to make sure Europe is safe. But that treaty no longer provided assurance in the same way that it did in the 1980s, and when that’s the case, President Trump is going to make sure we call that out.


QUESTION: So you do a tough-as-nails speech, and then Vladimir Putin in the Kremlin looks out and he sees Paris on fire, Greece riots, Italy fighting with the EU, the sclerotic EU bureaucracy driving the United Kingdom to the edge of political crisis. Can your speech, and can the United States, deter him when he sees Russia – when he sees Europe, in essence, in chaos?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Well the speech certainly sets down the marker, but what Russia understands, of course, is action. They understand actual responses. The United States under President Trump has been incredibly strong in doing that. We have provided defensive weapons systems to the Ukrainians. We have sanctioned senior officials inside of Russia. The list of our efforts to restore deterrence of Vladimir Putin is long. There still obviously remains a great deal of work to do.


QUESTION: Now Mr. Secretary, you also noted in your speech about the INF that there’s no advantage, no reason the United States should continue to cede this crucial military advantage to the revisionist powers like China, talking about China’s new missile capability. In the ’60 campaign, John F. Kennedy scored Richard Nixon for a missile gap. Do we presently have a, quote “hypersonics gap,” close quote, with China?


SECRETARY POMPEO: So I don’t want to say much about gaps because they have a long history of being misunderstood. Here’s what we can say with absolute certainty: The Chinese continue to build up their capabilities, their satellite capabilities, their hypersonic capabilities, their artificial intelligence capabilities, the capacity of the PLA to conduct operations not only in their territory but in a more expeditionary fashion.


The United States has a duty to defend itself, and we need to make sure that we have the resources and the right set of leaders and capabilities so that we don’t find ourselves in a place two, five, or 15 years from now where we no longer maintain the capacity to keep America safe and secure against all threats, especially including the one that the Chinese are building.


QUESTION: Now how is, in fact, the Chinese action different in kind from that of imperial Japan and their Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere? Are they acting as aggressively in these years as Japan did in the early ‘30s?


SECRETARY POMPEO: So they have taken actions that are very aggressive, and indeed in some cases, they have misled us. You’ll recall that in the Rose Garden, Xi confirmed that he would not militarize these – I’ll call them islands but these outposts in the South China Sea – and then, in fact, did. And so we now know that the intention of China is to continue to build out, to continue to expand their capability. And President Trump and President Xi talked about this some when they were together in Buenos Aires, and we are determined to make sure that America is prepared across every battlefront. I didn’t mention cyber previously. Each of these battlefronts is a place the United States must ensure we maintain our capacity to be the premier capability in the world.


QUESTION: Let me conclude, Mr. Secretary, and thank you for your time. Is the People’s Republic of China the greatest threat to the West now, greater than Russia, greater than Iran? Is it our hundred-year or two hundred-year threat, and do we have to think about it in those terms?


SECRETARY POMPEO: I don’t think there’s any doubt about that. Over the five, 10, 25-year time horizon, just by simple demographics and wealth, as well as by the internal system in that country, China presents the greatest challenge that the United States will face in the medium to long-term.


QUESTION: Mr. Secretary, Merry Christmas. I appreciate your taking the time. Congratulations on a big speech last week, and I hope it gets much, much broader repetition and broadcast.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Thank you. Merry Christmas to you, Hugh.


QUESTION: Merry Christmas.


SECRETARY POMPEO: You bet. So long, sir.

On behalf of the United States, I congratulate Senegal on the signing of its Millennium Challenge Corporation Compact. The $550 million Senegal Power Compact will modernize and strengthen Senegal’s power sector to increase economic growth and reduce poverty through improved access to electricity. The Government of Senegal will contribute an additional $50 million to the compact, bringing the total program to $600 million. The United States is committed to spurring economic growth in Africa through partnerships, such as this one. Senegal’s hard work in meeting MCC strict eligibility criteria is paying off in the form of a rare second MCC compact. American partnerships – seen through assistance projects like this one – are an essential part of our diplomacy.


In addition, the compact will complement the 'Power Africa' initiative implemented by USAID and other U.S. government agencies. This initiative is accelerating improvements across Sub-Saharan Africa’s power sector.


The United States celebrates this momentous occasion, the signing of the Millennium Challenge Corporation Senegal Power Compact, and remains committed to a strong bilateral and economic partnership with Senegal.

Corruption facilitates transnational crime, fuels terrorism, obstructs economic growth and development, weakens the rule of law, and undermines democracy. Ultimately, it endangers our national security. That is why, as we look ahead to International Anticorruption Day on December 9, we pledge to continue working with our partners to prevent and combat corruption worldwide.


The United States, through the U.S. Department of State and U.S. Agency for International Development, helps partner nations build transparent, accountable institutions and strengthen criminal justice systems that hold the corrupt accountable. We support civil society and journalists, who expose corruption and hold public officials to account. We prevent corruption by supporting global initiatives that rebuild citizen trust in government. We also hold corrupt actors accountable through targeted financial sanctions for corruption and human rights abuse through the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act.


On this day, we call on all countries to effectively implement their international anticorruption commitments, including through the UN Convention against Corruption. Through programs that recover and return stolen public funds, establish transparent, accountable institutions, and empower citizen-led action, the world can combat this threat to global security.

QUESTION: Secretary, good morning.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Hey, good morning. How are you, Andrew?


QUESTION: I’m very well. Welcome back to Kansas radio.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Great to be with you.


QUESTION: I’ll make this real quick. I know we have short amount of time. Back in September, you made a statement at a speech with the Family Research Council that 80 percent of the global population placed limits on religious freedom, and I wanted to get a comment from you on how do you see this issue in terms of not just globally but in America as well.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Well, Andrew, it’s – religious freedom is an important issue. It’s an important diplomatic and political issue, because with more religious freedom, it has a deep tendency not to create instability and cause war. And so at the State Department we’re working diligently. In fact, former Kansas Governor Sam Brownback is leading our efforts to improve religious freedom throughout the world for people of all faiths, people of no faith. The capacity to worship in the way that people want is an important element that the United States can always advocate for and help countries deliver.


QUESTION: Secretary, give us a quick overview of talks with North Korea and how a potential China deal may come together.


SECRETARY POMPEO: So we’re very hopeful that we can achieve a trade agreement with the Chinese. It’s being led by the Department of Treasury and others here in the United States Government. We want to make sure that Kansas wheat, Kansas product can be sold into the Chinese marketplace of 1.5 billion people, and we want to make sure that our products from America, from Kansas can be sold there. So we hope we can get that done in the next days.


With respect to North Korea, my task is very clear: The North Koreans have the capacity to deliver nuclear weaponry that could potentially harm folks in the United States. Chairman Kim committed to President Trump that he would give up those weapons, and it’s now time for us to deliver on that promise.


QUESTION: I wanted to get your reaction on the U.S. embassy in Jerusalem.


SECRETARY POMPEO: It was an important and bold step that President Trump took to move the U.S. embassy there. It was recognizing the reality on the ground, which is that this is the capital of Israel, and we have now taken that step and it has been important – important for the Jewish community, important for the evangelical community, and important to the United States and Israel to recognize that this is the natural capital of that country and that now our embassy, the United States embassy, is located there.


QUESTION: You said in a speech that freedom is a right, but in some countries it is an aspiration. Are you seeing that change?


SECRETARY POMPEO: I am but, unfortunately, changing in both directions. There are countries that are moving forward to a place where their people can live lives the way they want to, and I spoke about worship the way they want to. We have other countries where you see they’re regressing, moving backwards. So our task is to, in the first instance, make sure we keep America safe and secure and that we are a beacon to the world and that America can see – the world can see the freedoms that Americans have, and then use our diplomatic power to demonstrate that this is best for every country in the world and encourage them to move in that direction.


QUESTION: This morning we find out that the President has nominated Heather Nauert for the UN ambassador. What is your reaction?


SECRETARY POMPEO: So I’m thrilled with the President’s nomination of Heather. I’ve worked with her now since my time here – I guess seven, eight months now at the State Department. She’s done amazing work on behalf of the American people and I am convinced if she is confirmed, and I know that she will be, she will continue to do that, delivering as our ambassador to the United Nations.


QUESTION: When is your next State Department ministerial?


SECRETARY POMPEO: So our next religious freedom ministerial will be in the summer of next year. It was big this year, over 60-plus delegations from around the world. We’re hoping we can improve on that. And it was a great event in that people from all faiths came. There were satellite meetings all across Washington, D.C., people coming together to encourage each other and help get real, tangible results for people so that religious persecution of Christians and of folks of all religions can be reduced or diminished in every corner of the world.


QUESTION: One final question: What is it like dealing with and working with Kim Jong-un?


SECRETARY POMPEO: He has made a bold step and he has taken actions that neither – that we’ve not seen before, where he has made this commitment to denuclearize. I worked with him and we were able to get the three hostages returned to the United States. Perhaps one of the highlights of my professional career was coming back to America with those three hostages. And now we still have work to do. We still need to ensure a brighter future for North Korea, economic prosperity for those people, and the denuclearization of that country.


QUESTION: Secretary, thank you so much for your time. Go Army. I guess that’s who you’re voting for tomorrow.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Big day tomorrow, Andrew. And please say hi; I miss the people of Kansas as well.


QUESTION: Thank you, sir. Have a great day.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Bless you, Andrew.


QUESTION: God bless all the work you do.


SECRETARY POMPEO: You have a good day too. Thank you, sir.

QUESTION: We’re – well, it’s cold. I mean, as you expected, right?


SECRETARY POMPEO: I saw that. Yes, sir.


QUESTION: So man, so many things have happened since you’ve been on the show, Secretary. I mean, do you we call you Secretary? Is that the proper name?


SECRETARY POMPEO: It is, but you can call me Mike as you always did, so that’ll be just fine.


QUESTION: (Laughter.) I asked Sumair (ph) about that. I said, “What do I call him now?” He’s like, “Just call him Secretary.” I was like, “Okay.” So, I mean, this has been a whirlwind. You went there and you became the CIA director. Now you’re the Secretary of the State. What’s going on? Give us a little – give everybody in Kansas a little update of what’s happened with you.


SECRETARY POMPEO: It’s quite a privilege, and my Kansas roots have served me well. It’s hard work trying to make sure that we do all the things right to protect Americans and keep them safe. But it is a real opportunity to serve the country and working for President Trump trying to deliver a foreign policy that keeps our young men and women who are serving in America in uniform safe and all of you back at home in Kansas safe as well.


QUESTION: I love it. Okay, so you spent a lot of time in North Korea. We’re so interested in the – I mean, every time I turn on the TV you’re there and doing all the business that’s never been – never happened before in the history. Can you give us some details about that?


SECRETARY POMPEO: It’s been quite a experience to have the opportunity to try and figure out how to deliver for President Trump the outcome that Chairman Kim promised, right, to denuclearize, something that matters to everyone. Then I had the incredible good fortune to return to America with three American hostages, folks who had been held there for a long time, and bring them back safely to their families. It was one of the highlights of my professional life to get the chance to do that. And now the hard task, the hard task of denuclearizing North Korea, it still remains in front of us.


QUESTION: Yeah.


QUESTION: We saw you at President George H.W. Bush’s funeral, and just watching it on TV it was such an emotional experience. What was it like being there?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Oh goodness. It was – it was one of the greatness – one of the things that you see is about the greatness of America, the country coming together around someone who had committed his whole life to serving our country. He’d had one of the same jobs I did. He had been the CIA director. I had gotten to know he – him some during that time when I was CIA director. It was – it was really quite something to be there in that room with leaders from all around the world, leaders from the United States Congress, leaders in the executive branch, and then the Bush family, all paying tribute to a great American.


QUESTION: So being the CIA director and then the Secretary of State, which one did you lose the most sleep about? Like, which one’s harder to – I mean, are they both just like nonstop?


SECRETARY OF STATE: They’re both pretty busy, no doubt about that. Very different jobs for sure. Each one a real opportunity to serve with some great people here, the Foreign Service officers, the civil servants that work at the State Department, and before that the officers of the CIA. Great people. Patriots all, trying to get things done for us all around the world.


QUESTION: Well, I mean, you did a fantastic job of representing Kansas when you were in Congress, and everybody in Kansas loves that.


QUESTION: I’ve got one more question.


QUESTION: Go.


QUESTION: Did you get any of Lukas’s texts?


SECRETARY POMPEO: (Laughter.) I can’t say that I did.


QUESTION: I told him you probably changed your phone number.


QUESTION: I just congratulated him, that was it. That’s all I got. Well, listen, the Shockers play tomorrow against Oklahoma. I know you’re a big Shockers fan still, I hope.


SECRETARY POMPEO: I am. I know it’s on the road. I hope the weather’s good enough for everybody to get down to Norman and we can crush the Sooners.


QUESTION: Yes, look at that. All right. Secretary Pompeo, we love catching up with you. Thank you so much for spending time and calling us.

SECRETARY POMPEO: Good evening, everyone. I want to begin this evening by expressing my condolences to the Bush family on the passing of a great man, President George H. W. Bush. He embodied literally the best of America in his devotion to public service and his ardent patriotism. My wife Susan and I mourn with President Trump and all of our fellow Americans as we celebrate his incredible life. Tomorrow I will join the President and my fellow cabinet members in honoring him during America’s national day of mourning.


President Bush, during his entire lifetime, was a relentless defender of transatlantic security. Today, we strive to emulate his example by asserting powerful American leadership on behalf of our people and our allies. When the INF Treaty was inked in 1987, it represented a good-faith effort between two rivals to de-escalate the threat of nuclear war. President Reagan described it as the realization of “an impossible vision,” and Mikhail Gorbachev said it had “universal significance for mankind.”


But whatever successes this treaty helped produce, today we must confront Russian cheating on its arms control obligations. As I told my fellow ministers earlier today, our nations have a choice. We either bury our head in the sand or we take common-sense action in response to Russia’s flagrant disregard for the express terms of the INF Treaty.


It’s worth noting that Russia’s violations didn’t happen overnight. Russia’s been flight-testing the SSC-8 cruise missile since the mid-2000s. They’ve been testing it in excess of ranges that the treaty permits. All the tests of the SSC-8 have originated from a Kapustin Yar site from both a fixed and mobile launcher. Its range makes it a direct menace to Europe.


In 2017, General Selva of the Joint Chiefs of Staff told Congress that Russia had deployed its missile, and I quote, “in order to pose a threat to NATO and to facilities within the NATO area of responsibility,” end of quote. Russia continues to press forward, and as of late 2018 has filled multiple battalions of the SSC-8 missiles.


Throughout all of this, the United States has remained in scrupulous compliance with the treaty. In spite of Russia’s violations, we have exercised the utmost patience and effort in working to convince Russia to adhere to its terms. On at least 30 occasions since 2013, extending to the highest levels of leadership, we have raised Russia’s noncompliance and stressed that a failure to return to compliance would have consequences.


Russia’s reply has been consistent: deny any wrongdoing, demand more information, and issue baseless counter-accusations. For more than four years, Moscow has pretended that it didn’t know what missile or test the United States was even talking about, even when we provided extensive information about the missile’s characteristics and testing history. It was not until we chose to publicize the Russian name of the missile in November of 2017 that Russia finally acknowledged its existence. Then Russia changed its cover story from the missile that does not exist to the missile that exists but is treaty-compliant.


These violations of the INF Treaty cannot be viewed in isolation from the larger pattern of Russian lawlessness on the world stage. The list of Russia’s infamous acts is long: Georgia, Ukraine, Syria, election meddling, Skripal, and now the Kerch Strait, to name just a few.


In light of these facts, the United States today declares it has found Russia in material breach of the treaty and will suspend our obligations as a remedy effective in 60 days unless Russia returns to full and verifiable compliance.


We’re taking these steps for several reasons. First, Russia’s actions gravely undermine American national security and that of our allies and partners. It makes no sense for the United States to remain in a treaty that constrains our ability to respond to Russia’s violations. Russia has reversed the trajectory of diminishing nuclear risk in Europe, where America has tens of thousands of troops and where millions more American civilians are living and working. These Americans live and work alongside many more millions of Europeans who are put in danger by Russian missile systems.


Second, while Russia is responsible for the demise of the treaty, many other states – including China, North Korea, and Iran – are not parties to the INF Treaty. This leaves them free to build all the intermediate range missiles that they would like. There is no reason the United States should continue to cede this crucial military advantage to revisionist powers like China, in particular when these weapons are being used to threaten and coerce the United States and its allies in Asia.


If you ask the question why the treaty wasn’t enlarged to include more nations, including China, keep in mind that it has been tried three times without any success already, and it has failed each time.


Third, inertia will not drive policy in the Trump administration. As President Trump has made clear and as I spoke about this morning, the United States will not support international agreements that undermine our security, our interests, or our values.


Finally, and I want to be clear about this, America is upholding the rule of law. When we set forth our commitments, we agree to be bound by them. We expect the same of our treaty counterparts everywhere, and we will hold them accountable when their words prove untrustworthy. If we do not, we’ll get cheated by other nations, expose Americans to greater risk, and squander our credibility.


Earlier today, I spoke on America’s enduring leadership role in the international order and I reiterate that powerful American leadership means never abandoning our responsibility to protect our security and our nation’s sovereignty. I’ve stated our position in no uncertain terms. The United States remains hopeful that our relationship with Russia can get better, can get on better footing.


With that being said, the burden falls on Russia to make the necessary changes. Only they can save this treaty. If Russia admits its violations and fully and verifiably comes back into compliance we will, of course, welcome that course of action. But Russia and Russia only can take this step.


We appreciate NATO’s strong support for the United States decision as expressed in this statement released today. The United States and our NATO allies stand vigilant that Russia’s lawless conduct will not be tolerated in the realm of arms control or anywhere else.


Thank you.


MS NAUERT: We have time for several questions. The first one goes to Teri Schultz from Deutsche Welle. Teri.


QUESTION: Hi. Thank you. Secretary Pompeo, I’m here.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Got you.


QUESTION: What does this mean concretely? What will the next steps be? Are you just waiting the 60 days and hoping that Europe can help pull Russia back into compliance? What exactly – how exactly will this play out now? And then does the six months start in 60 days? Just a few more details on that. Thank you.


SECRETARY POMPEO: You bet. So as I said in my remarks, we would welcome a Russian change of heart, a change in direction, the destruction of their program and their follow-on continuance of the terms of the treaty. And so over the next 60 days they have every chance to do so. And we would welcome that.


I will tell you, our European partners appreciate that extra time. We work closely with them. They asked for an extended period, and we, in our efforts to make sure that we had complete unity – and I will tell you, as you speak to the other 28 ministers who are here today, there is complete unity around this – we believe this is the right outcome. The six-month period will begin to run 60 days from now. During the 60 days, we will still not test or produce or deploy any systems, and we’ll see what happens during this 60-day period.


We’ve talked to the Russians a great deal. We’re hopeful they’ll change course, but there’s been no indication to date that they have any intention of doing so.


MS NAUERT: Jessica Donati from Wall Street Journal.


QUESTION: Yeah. Thank you. Beyond withdrawing from the – or suspending your membership of the INF Treaty, what other steps can you do to help Ukraine in what it’s suffering at the hands of Russia?


SECRETARY POMPEO: So there was lots of discussion about that today. I’ll leave to a couple of others to talk about the conversations. But two things were very clear from the time that we spent with the Ukrainian foreign minister as a group, is that there is complete unanimity that the Russian action was lawless and unacceptable and deterrents must be restored, and that that is a collective commitment of Europe and the world to deny Russia the capacity to continue to violate basic international law norms. We hope that the Russians will return the sailors that they’re holding today, just immediately. And we will collectively develop a set of responses that demonstrate to Russia that this behavior is simply unacceptable.


MS NAUERT: Emerald Robinson from One America News.


QUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Secretary. You talked about, yes, the commitments with treaties in regards to the United States and its allies. But you also talked about international institutions and gave America’s viewpoint on that. You called out specifically the IMF and the World Bank and the UN. How do you think so many large international institutions can be reformed today? Is it a question of new leadership?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Every institution needs to be evaluated consistently, right. That doesn’t – multilateral, international organizations are no different. These organizations have now been around for an extended period of time, and each of them is worthy of full review. Do they still – are they still fit for purpose? Do they still serve their intended means? That’s what I spoke about this morning.


President Trump believes that if we exert American leadership and American national sovereignty and we evaluate these institutions against the objective of creating prosperity and peace around the world, that each of them is ripe for some piece of reform. And we’ll look at the parts that are working as I – and I described several institutions’ functions that are working. We’ll keep those. We’ll enhance those. We’ll want to be part of those.


But if it’s broken and it’s not delivering for America and for the world then we ought not rest on our laurels and think, “boy, that’s good,” just because it’s multilateral. That notion that the mere nature of something being multilateral is not in and of itself a good. The things that are good are the things that flow, the things that follow from the work that nation-states do as part of those multilateral organizations, and the United States is intent on being a leader to make sure each of those institutions that you mentioned is delivering.


MS NAUERT: Last question, Guy Taylor from Washington Times.


QUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Secretary. Back to the INF Treaty just for a second. You mentioned the prospect of the U.S. developing and deploying systems that would otherwise be in violation of the treaty. From a strategic perspective, is that kind of deployment something that the administration, the Trump administration, is really now preparing to do? And can you speak perhaps to European concerns about the prospect of the deployment of midrange nuclear weapons across Western Europe, for instance, that have been banned by this treaty for so long?


SECRETARY POMPEO: So I can say two things about that today. European nations can rest assured that as we prepare how we will all protect and create stability in Europe and around the world from the threat of intermediate nuclear range missiles, and those in particular from Russia, that we will be working closely with our European allies and other allies throughout the world who are also threatened by these missile systems. And so it won’t come to a surprise anyone what the United States is thinking, how we’re approaching it, and we will look for their assistance, their help, their inputs in how to develop a security architecture – an architecture that actually delivers.


I mean, we – just to be clear, we had a party – a treaty that had two parties, only one of which was compliant. That’s not an agreement. That’s just self-restraint, and it strategically no longer made sense to remain in that position and we’ll develop our course forward. I don’t want to say much about what the United States policy is going to be because there are lots of folks still to talk to. And I will also leave to the Department of Defense the nature and work that they’re doing on systems that will ultimately potentially be noncompliant.


MS NAUERT: Okay, thank you very much everyone. Thank you.

SECRETARY GENERAL STOLTENBERG: Let me just welcome you, Secretary Pompeo. It’s great to have you back here in NATO at the NATO headquarters, and many thanks for your strong personal commitment to this alliance. I remember just a few hours after you were appointed as Secretary of State, you came directly to the NATO foreign ministerial, and we are grateful for your leadership.


And at the meeting today and tomorrow we will address several issues, which are very important to our shared security. We’ll start with a meeting. We’ll be meeting with our colleagues from Ukraine and Georgia, addressing the security in the Black Sea and the situation in the Azov Sea. We will discuss transatlantic security, including the INF Treaty. And all of us are extremely concerned about the new Russian missiles. And we call on Russia to urgently ensure full compliance with the INF Treaty in a verifiable and transparent way. Burden sharing is also how we can step up our efforts to fight terrorism, support the training mission of NATO in Iraq and our presence in Afghanistan, are all the issues which we will discuss. So once again, welcome.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Thank you, General Stoltenberg. It’s great to be here. Thanks for hosting. I remember that day too, when I was the Secretary of State for just a few hours, then I was here. But just like that, it’s important. These gatherings are important to the world to show our determination. And as I said this morning in some remarks that I gave, this is an indispensable institution for stability in Europe and stability around the world. So I always look forward to coming here, being with you. You do a fantastic job leading this. President Trump said to send his regards, and I’m looking forward to our gathering.


SECRETARY GENERAL STOLTENBERG: Thank you so much.

SECRETARY POMPEO: Thank you, Ian, for the kind introduction. Good morning to all of you; thank you for joining me here today. It’s wonderful to be in this beautiful place, to get a chance to make a set of remarks about the very work that you do, the issues that confront the Marshall Fund and confront our region as well.


Before I start today with my formal remarks, it would be – I would be enormously remiss if I did not pay a well-deserved tribute to America’s 41st president, George Herbert Walker Bush. He was a – many of you know him. He was an unyielding champion of freedom around the world — first as a fighter pilot in World War II, later as a congressman. He was the ambassador to the United Nations, and then an envoy to China. He then had the same job I had as the director of the CIA – I did it longer than he did. He was then the vice president under Ronald Reagan.


I got to know him some myself. He was a wonderful brother, a father, a grandfather, and a proud American. Indeed, America is the only country he loved more than Texas. (Laughter.)


I actually think that he would be delighted for me to be here today at an institution named after a fellow lover of freedom, George Marshall. And he would have been thrilled to see all of you here, such a large crowd gathered who are dedicated to transatlantic bonds, so many decades after they were first forged.


The men who rebuilt Western civilization after World War II, like my predecessor Secretary Marshall, knew that only strong U.S. leadership, in concert with our friends and allies, could unite the sovereign nations all around the globe.


So we underwrote new institutions to rebuild Europe and Japan, to stabilize currencies, and to facilitate trade. We all co-founded NATO to guarantee security for ourselves and our allies. We entered into treaties to codify Western values of freedom and human rights.


Collectively, we convened multilateral organizations to promote peace and cooperation among states. And we worked hard – indeed, tirelessly – to preserve Western ideals because, as President Trump made clear in his Warsaw address, each of those are worth preserving.


This American leadership allowed us to enjoy the greatest human flourishing in modern history. We won the Cold War. We won the peace. With no small measure of George H. W. Bush’s effort, we reunited Germany. This is the type of leadership that President Trump is boldly reasserting.


After the Cold War ended, we allowed this liberal order to begin to corrode. It failed us in some places, and sometimes it failed you and the rest of the world. Multilateralism has too often become viewed as an end unto itself. The more treaties we sign, the safer we supposedly are. The more bureaucrats we have, the better the job gets done.


Was that ever really true? The central question that we face is that – is the question of whether the system as currently configured, as it exists today, and as the world exists today – does it work? Does it work for all the people of the world?


Today at the United Nations, peacekeeping missions drag on for decades, no closer to peace. The UN’s climate-related treaties are viewed by some nations as simply a vehicle to redistribute wealth. Anti-Israel bias has been institutionalized. Regional powers collude to vote the likes of Cuba and Venezuela onto the Human Rights Council. The UN was founded as an organization that welcomed peace-loving nations. I ask: Today, does it continue to serve its mission faithfully?


In the Western Hemisphere, has enough been done with the Organization of American States to promote its four pillars of democracy, human rights, security, and economic development in a region that includes the likes of Cuba, Venezuela, and Nicaragua?


In Africa, does the African Union advance the mutual interest of its nation-state members?


For the business community, from which I came, consider this: The World Bank and the International Monetary Fund were chartered to help rebuild war-torn territories and promote private investment and growth. Today, these institutions often counsel countries who have mismanaged their economic affairs to impose austerity measures that inhibit growth and crowd out private sector actors.


Here in Brussels, the European Union and its predecessors have delivered a great deal of prosperity to the entire continent. Europe is America’s single largest trading partner, and we benefit enormously from your success. But Brexit – if nothing else – was a political wake-up call. Is the EU ensuring that the interests of countries and their citizens are placed before those of bureaucrats here in Brussels?


These are valid questions. This leads to my next point: Bad actors have exploited our lack of leadership for their own gain. This is the poisoned fruit of American retreat. President Trump is determined to reverse that.


China’s economic development did not lead to an embrace of democracy and regional stability; it led to more political repression and regional provocations. We welcomed China into the liberal order, but never policed its behavior.


China has routinely exploited loopholes in the World Trade Organization rules, imposed market restrictions, forced technology transfers, and stolen intellectual property. And it knows that world opinion is powerless to stop its Orwellian human rights violations.


Iran didn’t join the community of nations after the nuclear deal was inked; it spread its newfound riches to terrorists and to dictators.


Tehran holds multiple American hostages, and Bob Levinson has been missing there for 11 years. Iran has blatantly disregarded UN Security Council resolutions, lied to the International Atomic Energy Agency inspectors about its nuclear program, and evaded UN sanctions. Just this past week, Iran test fired a ballistic missile, in violation of UN Security Council Resolution 2231.


Earlier this year, Tehran used the U.S.-Iran Treaty of Amity to bring baseless claims against the United States before the International Court of Justice – most all of this malign activity during the JCPOA.


Russia. Russia hasn’t embraced Western values of freedom and international cooperation. Rather, it has suppressed opposition voices and invaded the sovereign nations of Georgia and of Ukraine.


Moscow has also deployed a military-grade nerve agent on foreign soil, right here in Europe, in violation of the Chemical Weapons Convention to which it is a party. And as I’ll detail later today, Russia has violated the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty for many years.


The list goes on. We have to account for the world order of today in order to chart the way forward. It is what America’s National Security Strategy deemed “principled realism.” I like to think of it as “common sense.”


Every nation – every nation – must honestly acknowledge its responsibilities to its citizens and ask if the current international order serves the good of its people as well as it could. And if not, we must ask how we can right it.


This is what President Trump is doing. He is returning the United States to its traditional, central leadership role in the world. He sees the world as it is, not as we wish it to be. He knows that nothing can replace the nation-state as the guarantor of democratic freedoms and national interests. He knows, as George H.W. Bush knew, that a safer world has consistently demanded American courage on the world stage. And when we – and when we all of us ignore our responsibilities to the institutions we’ve formed, others will abuse them.


Critics in places like Iran and China – who really are undermining the international order – are saying the Trump administration is the reason this system is breaking down. They claim America is acting unilaterally instead of multilaterally, as if every kind of multilateral action is by definition desirable. Even our European friends sometimes say we’re not acting in the world’s interest. This is just plain wrong.


Our mission is to reassert our sovereignty, reform the liberal international order, and we want our friends to help us and to exert their sovereignty as well. We aspire to make the international order serve our citizens – not to control them. America intends to lead – now and always.


Under President Trump, we are not abandoning international leadership or our friends in the international system. Indeed, quite the contrary. Just look, as one example, at the historic number of countries which have gotten on board our pressure campaign against North Korea. No other nation in the world could have rallied dozens of nations, from every corner of the world, to impose sanctions on the regime in Pyongyang.


International bodies must help facilitate cooperation that bolsters the security and values of the free world, or they must be reformed or eliminated.


When treaties are broken, the violators must be confronted, and the treaties must be fixed or discarded. Words should mean something.


Our administration is thus lawfully exiting or renegotiating outdated or harmful treaties, trade agreements, and other international arrangements that do not serve our sovereign interests, or the interests of our allies.


We announced our intent to withdraw from the Paris Agreement on climate change, absent better terms for the United States. The current pact would’ve siphoned money from American paychecks and enriched polluters like China.


In America, we’ve found a better solution – we think a better solution for the world. We’ve unleashed our energy companies to innovate and compete, and our carbon emissions have declined dramatically.


We changed course from the Iran deal, because of, among other things, Tehran’s violent and destabilizing activities, which undermined the spirit of the deal and put the safety of American people and our allies at risk. In its place, we are leading our allies to constrain Iran’s revolutionary ambitions and end Iran’s campaigns of global terrorism. And we needn’t a new bureaucracy to do it. We need to continue to develop a coalition which will achieve that outcome which will keep people in the Middle East, in Europe, and the entire world safe from the threat from Iran.


America renegotiated our treaty, NAFTA, to advance the interests of the American worker. President Trump proudly signed the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement at the G20 this past weekend in Buenos Aires, and on Friday will submit it to the Congress, a body accountable to the American people.


The new agreement also includes renegotiation provisions, because no trade agreement is permanently suited to all times.


We have encouraged our G20 partners to reform the WTO, and they took a good first step in Buenos Aires this last week.


I spoke earlier about the World Bank and the IMF. The Trump Administration is working to refocus these institutions on policies that promote economic prosperity, pushing to halt lending to nations that can already access global capital markets – countries like China – and pressing to reduce taxpayer handouts to development banks that are perfectly capable of raising private capital on their own.


We’re also taking leadership, real action to stop rogue international courts, like the International Criminal Court, from trampling on our sovereignty – your sovereignty – and all of our freedoms. The ICC’s Office of the Prosecutor is trying to open an investigation into U.S. personnel in connection with the war in Afghanistan. We will take all necessary steps to protect our people, those of our NATO allies who fight alongside of us inside of Afghanistan from unjust prosecution. Because we know that if it can happen to our people, it can happen to yours too. It is a worthy question: Does the court continue to serve its original intended purpose?


The first two years of the Trump administration demonstrate that President Trump is not undermining these institutions, nor is he abandoning American leadership. Quite the opposite. In the finest traditions of our great democracy, we are rallying the noble nations of the world to build a new liberal order that prevents war and achieves greater prosperity for all.


We’re supporting institutions that we believe can be improved; institutions that work in American interests – and yours – in service of our shared values.


For example, here in Belgium in 1973, banks from 15 countries formed SWIFT to develop common standards for cross-border payments, and it’s now an integral part of our global financial infrastructure.


SWIFT recently disconnected sanctioned Iranian banks from its platform because of the unacceptable risk they pose to a system – to the system as a whole. This is an excellent example of American leadership working alongside an international institution to act responsibly.


Another example: the Proliferation Security Initiative, formed by 11 nations under the Bush administration to stop trafficking in weapons of mass destruction. It has since grown organically to 105 countries and has undoubtedly made the world safer.


And I can’t forget, standing here, one of the most important international institutions of them all – which will continue to thrive with American leadership. My very first trip, within hours of having been sworn in as a secretary of state, I traveled here to visit with our NATO allies. I’ll repeat this morning what I said then – this is an indispensable institution. President Trump wants everyone to pay their fair share so we can deter our enemies and defend people – the people of our countries.


To that end, all NATO allies should work to strengthen what is already the greatest military alliance in all of history.


Never – never – has an alliance ever been so powerful or so peaceful, and our historic ties must continue.


To that end, I’m pleased to announce that I will host my foreign minister colleagues for a meeting in Washington next April, where we will mark NATO’s 70th anniversary.


As my remarks come to a close, I want to repeat what George Marshall told the UN General Assembly back near the time of its formation in 1948. He said, quote, “International organizations cannot take the place of national and personal effort or of local and individual imagination; international action cannot replace self-help.” End of quote.


Sometimes it’s not popular to buck the status quo, to call out that which we all see but sometimes refuse to speak about. But frankly, too much is at stake for all of us in this room today not to do so. This is the reality that President Trump so viscerally understands.


Just as George Marshall’s generation gave life to a new vision for a safe and free world, so we call on you to have the same kind of boldness. Our call is especially urgent – especially urgent in light of the threats we face from powerful countries and actors whose ambition is to reshape the international order in its own illiberal image.


Let’s work together. Let’s work together to preserve the free world so that it continues to serve the interests of the people to whom we each are accountable.


Let’s do so in a way that creates international organizations that are agile, that respect national sovereignty, that deliver on their stated missions, and that create value for the liberal order and for the world.


President Trump understands deeply that when America leads, peace and prosperity almost certainly follow.


He knows that if America and our allies here in Europe don’t lead, others will choose to do so.


America will, as it has always done, continue to work with our allies around the world towards the peaceful, liberal order each citizen of the world deserves.


Thank you for joining me here today. May the Good Lord bless each and every one of you. Thank you. (Applause.)

QUESTION: Secretary Pompeo, thank you very much for this opportunity with the Spanish division of Voice of America.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Gesell, it’s great to be with you. Thank you for the opportunity.


QUESTION: I just want to begin asking you some thoughts about former President Bush.


SECRETARY POMPEO: So I had a chance to get to know him just a little bit while I served in Congress, and then I held a job that he held as the director of the Central Intelligence Agency. He was a great mentor. He was an incredibly kind man. He was a patriot of the highest order. Susan and I’s sympathy go out to the entire Bush family. America will miss this amazing warrior, this amazing leader, this amazing American patriot.


QUESTION: Thank you. Now about the G20: What is the U.S. doing to find common ground with so many leaders with so many different agendas here at the G20?


SECRETARY POMPEO: So it’s the case – 20 countries plus some multilateral organizations, lots of different views, but commonly we all share the intense desire to grow economies all around the world, to create prosperity for every citizen of the world, to develop rules that permit that to happen. These are common themes. Sometimes we’ll argue about how best to achieve them, but everyone’s headed towards the same set of objectives. We know that if we get growth, we get prosperity, we get freedom all around the world, that the lives of hundreds of millions of people will be improved, and that’s the mission statement that the G20 gathers around each time it joins its hands together.


QUESTION: This is the first time President Donald Trump visits the region. This could means a new relationship with Latin America, taking into consideration that China is also getting new friends in the region.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Yes. Look, we consider our relationship with South America, Central America, Mexico to be central to American success. President Trump has been committed to that since the very beginning of his time in office. It’s wonderful now that he’s had a chance to get down here. He’s known President Macri for a long time, and they had a wonderful meeting yesterday where they came around a set of objectives that our two countries will now begin to implement. And so we’re excited about that. We think having a great, close relationship with America is really important, and we are all concerned about China and the way China enters countries. It is not always the case that when China shows up, it’s with a good intention for the people of the country they are showing up to ostensibly support. It’s most often about China.


QUESTION: About Venezuela, President Trump talk about Venezuela with President Macri. Are there new actions being considered or analyzed to take against Nicolas Maduro government and to help Venezuelans?


SECRETARY POMPEO: I don’t have anything specific that I can share with you today, but we’ve had a number of conversations down here at the G20, and President Trump is very determined. The Maduro regime must restore democracy. They – the current situation is intolerable. The people of Venezuela are suffering and democracy must be restored, and we’ve done a great deal so far along with many South American countries and Central American countries. We worry. We know we’ve had migration into Argentina, into other countries here, people fleeing this despot, this dictator in Venezuela. And so I don’t have anything specific that I can share with you today, but the determination for all of the countries in the region to join hands with the United States to restore democracy in Venezuela remains strong.


QUESTION: On immigration, hundreds of people from Central America try to enter the United States every day. What the U.S. can do to create more opportunities in Central America, in the region for Central Americans so they don’t have the need to look forward for a better life in the U.S.?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Gesell, that’s a great question. I’ve had the chance to get to know my incoming counterpart in Mexico. I’ve had a chance to work with the Northern Triangle countries. We are determined to do what the new government that’ll be sworn in today in Mexico has talked with us about to make sure that we do create opportunities in the Northern Triangle so these people will have better lives there. After all, that’s what it’s really all about. It’s the capacity to live their lives the way they want to with economic success and freedom. We’re committed to assisting in that, and in the time that we can’t get there, we’re also determined to make sure the human rights of the migrants are respected, at the same time enforcing U.S. law.


QUESTION: After this trip, any new trip to visit any country in Latin America for you, Secretary Pompeo?


SECRETARY POMPEO: It’s very likely I’ll be right back down here just right at the first of the year, and I’m looking forward to that. Nothing to announce, but I’ll be back. I’ve been here a number of times. I’ll be back before too long.


QUESTION: Thank you very much for your time.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Thank you, sir.


QUESTION: Thank you.

",Interview With Gesell Tobias of Voice of America Latin America,http://www.state.gov/secretary/remarks/2018/12/287723.htm
"December 1, 2018","
QUESTION: Mr. Secretary, thanks so much for joining us.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Wolf, it’s great to be with you.


QUESTION: Let’s talk about the late President George H.W. Bush. How do you see his legacy?


SECRETARY POMPEO: It’s a remarkable American legacy, and they don’t make them like that very often. I had the chance to get to know him when I was a member of Congress first and then I held a job that he held at one point, and I remember talking to him just after I was nominated to be the CIA director. He said you’ll be great, you’ll be awesome. In fact, it was the second-best job I ever had, and he loved that group of people, that talented espionage agency so much. America is worse off today. I want to extend my and Susan’s heartfelt sympathy to the entire Bush family.


QUESTION: What lessons can politicians today learn from the life he led?


SECRETARY POMPEO: It was a true life of service. He was also committed to his faith and he was (inaudible) work really hard. Maybe those would be the three things – if you work at it, if you keep your faith, and you have this commitment to serve, good things can happen. Not only to him – he had a remarkable life – but you’ll do good work for your fellow man as well. President Bush certainly did that.


QUESTION: He was an amazing man and I was blessed myself to have interviewed him on several occasions. I know if he were here, he’d want us to get to substantive issues, so in his memory, let’s talk about some of the major national security issues facing the U.S. right now.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Yes, sir.


QUESTION: Saudi Arabia. Do you believe the Saudi explanation that the crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, did not know about the murder of Jamal Khashoggi?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Wolf, I’ve spoken about this a lot. I continue to work on this issue. President Trump and this administration sanctioned 17 people that we came to learn were connected to the murder – heinous murder – of Jamal Khashoggi. All across the United States government we continue to investigate, to try and learn, to make determinations about what happened, and we’ll continue to hold those responsible accountable. We’ve been very clear, very clear about that since literally the very beginning.


We also, Wolf – and this is important – are doing everything we can to make sure that we get it right for America, that we keep the strategic relationship with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and protect the American people. Those two things can both be done and we’ve done it very effectively.


QUESTION: Because you have said that – and you’re a former CIA director, so you understand how U.S. intelligence analysis works – you said there’s no direct reporting connecting the crown prince to order the murder of Jamal Khashoggi. Can you confidently tell his four children that he was not involved in that order?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Well, obviously, sitting in an unclassified setting, here’s what I can say: I have read every piece of intelligence that is in the possession of the United States geovernment, and when it is done, when you complete that analysis, there’s no direct evidence linking him to the murder of Jamal Khashoggi. That is a accurate statement, it is an important statement, and it is the statement that we are making publicly today.


QUESTION: Did the CIA conclude with high confidence that he was involved?


SECRETARY POMPEO: I can’t comment on intelligence matters or CIA conclusions. I didn’t do it when I was director; I’m not going to do it now.


QUESTION: Because you’ve seen all the reports in the media about it.


SECRETARY POMPEO: I’ve seen lots of reports in the media, Wolf. They often are untrue.


QUESTION: So the bottom line is that the U.S. is going to continue to maintain the same relationship, strategic or operation, with Saudi Arabia right now, irrespective of what may have happened?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Today we’re working with the Saudis in Afghanistan, we’re working with the Saudis to push back against Ayatollah Khamenei, who killed hundreds of Americans, Wolf, and they are an enormous support to us. They are a relationship that has mattered for 70 years across Republican and Democrat administrations alike. It remains an important relationship and we’re aiming to keep that relationship with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.


QUESTION: Because you’re losing support in Congress, even – including among Republicans right now for – to continue U.S. support for the Saudi operation in Yemen. Even Lindsey Graham voted against your position. There were 14 Republican senators who voted against you the other day in the Senate.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Secretary Mattis and I and the President have made very clear we’re working to end the hostilities in Yemen. The humanitarian crisis there is of epic proportions, millions of people at or near starvation. This administration has put almost a billion dollars into stopping that humanitarian crisis. The Saudis have put even more money in of theirs. The Iranians, Wolf, have put zero dollars in to stopping that humanitarian crisis, and we are determined to fix the problem of the humanitarian crisis while ensuring that we don’t end up with a Hizballah organization on the southern edge of Saudi Arabia.


QUESTION: So U.S. military support for the Saudis in Yemen will continue?


SECRETARY POMPEO: The program that we’re involved in today we intend to continue.


QUESTION: Let’s talk about Russia, another critical issue. Why did the President decide to cancel what was supposed to be a two-hour face-to-face meeting with the Russian leader?


SECRETARY POMPEO: I can actually answer that. I was there. He canceled it because the Russians behaved in a way that is deeply inconsistent with international law and is outrageous. To have held the Ukrainians that they took in the strait needs to be changed. The President wanted to send a clear, unambiguous message that we find that type of behavior unacceptable, and so he canceled the meeting.


QUESTION: But the Russians – well, the Russians – the Russians have done other awful things and the President went ahead in Helsinki and met --


SECRETARY POMPEO: This happened hours, days before – the series of events unfolded days --


QUESTION: But wouldn’t it be a good time for him to have a face-to-face --


SECRETARY POMPEO: (Inaudible) hours and days, Wolf, hours and days before, and the President made the decision that the right thing to do was tell the Russians return the sailors, return the Ukrainian equipment, it’s theirs. The people need to be returned to their families, and he wanted to send an unambiguous message that the Russians needed to change that act.


QUESTION: It had nothing to do with the announcement that came just an hour earlier before he boarded Air Force One to fly here to Argentina that Michael Cohen was cooperating with Mueller and all these new information – details about a supposed Trump Tower project in Moscow?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Ludicrous. Washington parlor game.


QUESTION: Well, explain, because it --


SECRETARY POMPEO: I was involved in the decision, Wolf. I can explain (inaudible).


QUESTION: You were aboard Air Force One.


SECRETARY POMPEO: I was aboard Air Force One.


QUESTION: And nobody discussed Michael Cohen?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Wolf, this is the thing that the American people need to understand about Washington, D.C.: It makes stuff up that is wholly unfounded. I was involved in the decision-making process. We evaluated it – we considered the opportunity to speak with him, we considered the message we would send. President Trump made the decision this was the right approach based on the activity that had taken place in the lead-up to the G20 summit.


QUESTION: So is there going to be an opportunity down the road for the President to meet with Putin?


SECRETARY POMPEO: President’s made clear the conditions for that meeting.


QUESTION: What are the conditions?


SECRETARY POMPEO: We want the sailors returned, we want the ships returned.


QUESTION: And once the Russians do that, there will be a summit?


SECRETARY POMPEO: President has said he wants to meet. He wants to have a conversation with President Putin. There are lots of things that we need to find paths forward on together, lots of places Americans are at risk. He’s trying to find a way to move forward with Russia, and now this jumped in the middle of a time when they could have begun to have a discussion where we might have made some progress. We regret that, but the Russians caused this meeting to be canceled by their behavior in the Kerch Strait.


QUESTION: When is the President going to meet again with the North Korean leader?


SECRETARY POMPEO: I don’t know. I hope it’ll happen pretty soon. We’re working hard at it. I think it’ll happen shortly after the first of the year but I don’t have any additional information to share with you this morning, Wolf.


QUESTION: What’s the problem right now with the North Koreans?


SECRETARY POMPEO: The progress – yes. Well, the progress we’ve made has been good.


QUESTION: No, what’s the problem?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Well, the progress we’ve made has been good. We’re not having missiles launched, there haven’t been any nuclear tests. We continue to have conversations about the right next step – that is the right substantive next step, not the process next step of meetings. We’re working with partners all across the world – South Koreans, the Japanese. Remember, Wolf, these are global sanctions put in place by the United Nations Security Council which deny North Korea the capacity to improve their economy. That’s not going to change, unlike previous administrations that when they got to a point that became difficult wrote checks for tens and hundreds of millions of dollars and let the North Koreans off the hook in that sense. We’re determined to fulfill the commitments that were made by Chairman Kim in Singapore and we’re working hard at it.


QUESTION: A final question on Mexico. It looks like U.S.-Mexican relations are improving, right? You’re off to Mexico for the inauguration of the new president, and the President – President Trump signed together with the leaders of Mexico and Canada the U.S.-Mexico-Canada new trade agreement. But there’s still a lot of tension along the border and there’s a lot of uproar about whether or not the U.S. should go ahead and build a new wall, spend all that money. What ever happened to the President’s commitment for so long during the campaign that Mexico would pay for the wall?


SECRETARY POMPEO: That wall’s going to get built. I have already developed a good relationship with my counterpart, Marcelo Ebrard, the incoming foreign secretary of Mexico. We’ve met a number of times already. I’m unfortunately not going to make the inauguration, as it’s taking place today in Mexico, but he’ll travel to Washington on what I guess would be his second day in office and we’re going to continue to develop this relationship.


It’s not just focused on the migration issues that draw all the headlines. There are many economic issues between our two countries and other commercial – we have transnational criminal organizations that we work on together. It’s a broad set of relationships. We’re going to work to help build the Mexican economy in the southern part of their nation, work with the Northern Triangle countries too. Those are important elements of what we’re trying to accomplish, and soon-to-be Foreign Secretary – I guess within hours – Ebrard and I are working hard at it.


QUESTION: And Mexico paying for the wall?


SECRETARY POMPEO: We’re going to get the wall built, Wolf.


QUESTION: But will Mexico pay for it?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Wolf, we’re going to get the wall built.


QUESTION: I’ll leave it on that.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Thank you, sir.


QUESTION: Mr. Secretary, you’ve got a busy schedule ahead of you. Thanks so much time for spending some time with us.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Thank you, Wolf. Have a great day.

The Iranian regime has just test-fired a medium range ballistic missile that is capable of carrying multiple warheads. The missile has a range that allows it to strike parts of Europe and anywhere in the Middle East. This test violates UN Security Council resolution 2231 that bans Iran from undertaking “any activity related to ballistic missiles designed to be capable of delivering nuclear weapons, including launches using such ballistic missile technology . . .”


As we have been warning for some time, Iran’s missile testing and missile proliferation is growing. We are accumulating risk of escalation in the region if we fail to restore deterrence. We condemn these activities, and call upon Iran to cease immediately all activities related to ballistic missiles designed to be capable of delivering nuclear weapons.

Devoted husband, loving father, steadfast friend, exemplary patriot: this is how I will always remember President George H. W. Bush. Whether he was serving in the skies over the Pacific during World War II, protecting America at CIA headquarters, or leading our nation in the Oval Office, President Bush was one of America’s most consequential and dedicated public servants. In his private life, he was a devoted family man who exuded kindness and respect to everyone he met. I am privileged to have known him as a friend, and I will always treasure the special bond we shared of having led the world’s finest intelligence service. Though our hearts are heavy today, we take comfort in knowing he is no longer apart from his beloved wife Barbara. My thoughts and prayers, as well as those of my State Department colleagues, are with the entire Bush family.

SECRETARY POMPEO: Well, good morning, everyone. Secretary Mattis and myself just had the opportunity to brief all the senators who wanted to hear from us. We talked about U.S. policy in Yemen, the U.S. policy with respect to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. We also, obviously, spoke about the heinous murder of Jamal Khashoggi, and we made clear that they’re considering debating a resolution on the Senate floor which we think is just poorly timed. We are on the cusp of allowing the U.S. envoy, Martin Griffiths, to, in December, gather the parties together and hopefully get a ceasefire in Yemen, something that we have diplomatically been striving for for months, and we think we’re right on the cusp of that. So it is the view of the administration, Secretary Mattis, and myself that passing a resolution at this point undermines that. It would encourage the Houthis, it would encourage the Iranians; it would undermine the fragile agreement for everyone to go to Sweden and have this discussion.


So we hope that they’ll consider that, be thoughtful in how they proceed, and we’re happy to give them further information if they should so choose.


QUESTION: Mr. Secretary, you’re the former CIA director. Why wasn’t the current CIA director here briefing senators as well?


SECRETARY POMPEO: I was asked to be here and here I am.


QUESTION: (Inaudible.) Senators were very frustrated. Normally, in your past role as CIA director, you would be here briefing these senators on an issue this sensitive. Why isn’t the CIA director herself here today?


SECRETARY POMPEO: I was asked to be here, and I’m here.


QUESTION: (Off-mike.)


QUESTION: Secretary Pompeo (inaudible) you’ve seen all the intelligence, presumably. Do you believe that the crown prince of Saudi Arabia ordered Jamal Khashoggi’s killing?


SECRETARY POMPEO: I do believe I’ve read every piece of intelligence. Unless it’s come in in the last few hours, I think I have read it all. There is no direct reporting connecting the crown prince to the order to murder Jamal Khashoggi. And that’s all I can say in an unclassified setting.


QUESTION: Mr. Secretary, is he responsible --


MS NAUERT: Thank you. We’ve got to go.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Yes, ma’am.


QUESTION: Are there any scheduled high-level meetings with North Korea? Are there any scheduled high-level meetings with North Korea?


SECRETARY POMPEO: I don’t have anything to add on the sequence of events in North Korea. But I’m very hopeful we will have senior-level meetings before too long.


QUESTION: (Off-mike.)


QUESTION: Is MBS responsible?


QUESTION: You say you’re on the precipice of a deal.


SECRETARY POMPEO: I didn’t say deal.


QUESTION: Or a – a peace agreement.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Yeah. Of the first opportunity for them to get together, yes.


QUESTION: All of Trump’s public statements indicate that Iran is very far from coming to the table for negotiations. How do you rectify the two? Which is true?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Well, the parties that will be there will be those who are engaged in the civil war in Yemen, so there will be representatives from the Yemeni Government, from the Houthis, all those interested parties. We hope the Iranians won’t upset the apple cart. They have been funding, arming, providing assistance and support to the Houthis, which have allowed the Houthis to continue to fight well beyond what would have made any sense at all, and we do hope the Iranians won’t upset this opportunity to both resolve the civil war and give everyone the opportunity to resolve a massive humanitarian crisis that’s in Yemen today.

SECRETARY POMPEO: Well, good morning everyone. I’m delighted to have the opportunity to welcome you all to the State Department. It is wonderful, and I am proud that we have so many partners linking arms with us in the global fight against HIV/AIDS.


I want to thank Ambassador Deborah Birx and our entire PEPFAR team. You all do amazing work, and putting the summit together has been amazing too. I know great things will come for the world from the work that you and your team are doing.


As the Secretary of State, I know as well as anyone that reading the world news can often be a real downer. If you open the paper or log on to Twitter in the morning, you see a litany of things that make you sad and make you shudder and make you worry and pray. It can seem like not a single good thing is happening.


But dig further. As men and women of faith, we know that we do not inhabit a hopeless place. Good things are happening in the world all over. They don’t often generate headlines every day, but when we see things like the massive success of PEPFAR we can have renewed confidence that there is still good news to tell, that the world can be a better place, and that America is still the greatest national force for good in human history.


It’s now 15 years ago when President George W. Bush established PEPFAR as a 21st century statement of America’s concern for the most vulnerable. President Trump has remained committed to these efforts to end the AIDS pandemic.


Since the launch in 2003 of PEPFAR – thanks to strong support from three presidents, multiple Congresses, and our many partners around the globe – we have saved more than 17 million lives. We have prevented millions of new HIV infections. And AIDS-related deaths globally have been cut in half since their peak in 2004. Quite simply, the HIV/AIDS pandemic has gone from crisis towards control.


And at every step of the way, people like you – faith leaders, faith-based organizations, and communities of faith – have been cornerstones of our effort. You were in the communities hardest hit by AIDS long before the pandemic began, and we know you will be there long after the epidemic is controlled. In some parts of the world, in some places, faith-based institutions provide as much as 70 percent of healthcare delivery to people living with and affected by HIV/AIDS. That’s a remarkable testimony to your passion, your caring, your commitment, and to your love for your fellow man.


Because of the clear value of faith-based organizations in the fight against HIV/AIDS, the United States is proud to invest in you, you who are doing this outstanding work. Our investment to faith-based organizations is institutional, not ideological. We need to keep reaching the populations we are missing in our HIV/AIDS response, accelerate progress in controlling the pandemic, and ensure that our efforts are sustainable as well.


This summit is designed to allow each of you to share exciting ideas how to make this happen, to explore what can we – what we can do to expand our efforts, and to ensure that the pandemic is indeed controlled.


The 2018 PEPFAR Strategy Progress Report, which I released this past September, shows the strides we have taken – strides we have taken together. Guided by the Trump administration’s PEPFAR Strategy, up to 13 high-HIV-burden countries are poised to achieve epidemic control within the next two years. What I am particularly proud of in this strategy is that PEPFAR and our partners are firmly focused on populations that are often being left behind, including young women, men, and children.


I know you as faith leaders will appreciate this analogy when I say this concern for the most vulnerable resembles Jesus’ parable of the lost sheep. He says that a good shepherd goes after that one lost sheep at all costs, even though he already has the other 99 in his flock. Even though our faith-based partners have already helped save millions of lives, we know that we will not get complacent. And thank you for that. You all are driven by a higher motivation, and we will see this work through to its end.


Today, I am also pleased to announce PEPFAR’s latest annual program results. As of September 30th of this year, PEPFAR supports over 14.6 million people with lifesaving antiretroviral treatment. This is up from the only 50,000 who were on treatment in Africa when the program began back in 2003.


I am also pleased to announce new and exciting progress toward achieving epidemic control in Nigeria and Ethiopia. We aren’t announcing the specific data sets just yet, but Ethiopia is on the verge of achieving HIV epidemic control – a remarkable accomplishment. And Nigeria may be closer to achieving HIV epidemic control than was previously thought, or even previously thought possible. This is remarkable work. The majority of Nigerians who report being on HIV treatment have suppressed their viral replication, allowing them to thrive and not to transmit the virus.


There’s one more great story that I want to share with you this morning. It’s a story about PEPFAR mattering to all Americans. By focusing resources where the HIV burden is the greatest – and where the highest impacts can be achieved – PEPFAR demonstrates the power of U.S. foreign assistance when it is tied to accountability, transparency, efficiency, and effectiveness.


So many times in Washington, the proposed solution to every problem is simply more money, regardless of whether it actually solves a problem. But the investment we ask taxpayers to make in PEPFAR is clearly paying dividends of life and hope. We can measure it, and we can see the effectiveness. And you all are in good part responsible for that.


Today, a generation that could have been lost is instead thriving and building a brighter future. PEPFAR has truly been one of the great American triumphs of the 21st century. And we’re proud to continue this work alongside each of you, our faith-based partners.


Thank you all. Thank you all for being here. And may the Good Lord bless each and every one of you. Thank you. (Applause.)

We don’t condone Jamal Khashoggi’s murder. But the kingdom is a powerful force for Mideast stability.


The Trump administration’s effort to rebuild the U.S.-Saudi Arabia partnership isn’t popular in the salons of Washington, where politicians of both parties have long used the kingdom’s human-rights record to call for the alliance’s downgrading. The October murder of Saudi national Jamal Khashoggi in Turkey has heightened the Capitol Hill caterwauling and media pile-on. But degrading U.S.-Saudi ties would be a grave mistake for the national security of the U.S. and its allies.


The kingdom is a powerful force for stability in the Middle East. Saudi Arabia is working to secure Iraq’s fragile democracy and keep Baghdad tethered to the West’s interests, not Tehran’s. Riyadh is helping manage the flood of refugees fleeing Syria’s civil war by working with host countries, cooperating closely with Egypt, and establishing stronger ties with Israel. Saudi Arabia has also contributed millions of dollars to the U.S.-led effort to fight Islamic State and other terrorist organizations. Saudi oil production and economic stability are keys to regional prosperity and global energy security.


Is it any coincidence that the people using the Khashoggi murder as a cudgel against President Trump’s Saudi Arabia policy are the same people who supported Barack Obama’s rapprochement with Iran—a regime that has killed thousands world-wide, including hundreds of Americans, and brutalizes its own people? Where was this echo chamber, where were these avatars of human rights, when Mr. Obama gave the mullahs pallets of cash to carry out their work as the world’s largest state sponsor of terrorism?


Saudi Arabia, like the U.S.—and unlike these critics—recognizes the immense threat the Islamic Republic of Iran poses to the world. Modern-day Iran is, in Henry Kissinger’s term, a cause, not a nation. Its objectives are to spread the Islamic revolution from Tehran to Damascus, to destroy Israel, and to subjugate anyone who refuses to submit, starting with the Iranian people. An emboldened Iran would spread even more death and destruction in the Middle East, spark a regional nuclear-arms race, threaten trade routes, and foment terrorism around the world.


One of Mohammed bin Salman’s first acts as Saudi crown prince was an effort to root out Iran’s destabilizing influence in Yemen, where the Tehran-backed Houthi rebels seized power in 2015. Tehran is establishing a Hezbollah-like entity on the Arabian Peninsula: a militant group with political power that can hold Saudi population centers hostage, as Hezbollah’s missiles in southern Lebanon threaten Israel. The Houthis have occupied Saudi territory, seized a major port, and, with Iranian help, improved their ballistic-missile targeting so that they can shoot at Riyadh’s international airport, through which tens of thousands of Americans travel. Meanwhile, Tehran has shown no genuine interest in a diplomatic solution to the Yemen conflict.


The Trump administration has taken many steps to mitigate Yemen’s suffering from war, disease and famine. We have exerted effort to improve Saudi targeting to minimize civilian casualties, and we have galvanized humanitarian assistance through our own generous example.


The U.S. is pleased to announce it is providing nearly $131 million in additional food assistance for Yemen, bringing total humanitarian aid to more than $697 million over the past 14 months. The funds are being provided to the World Food Program and other organizations working to feed the Yemeni people.


Without U.S. efforts, the death toll in Yemen would be far higher. There would be no honest broker to manage disagreements between Saudi Arabia and its Gulf coalition partners, whose forces are essential to the war effort. Iran has no interest in easing Yemeni suffering; the mullahs don’t even care for ordinary Iranians. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has invested billions to relieve suffering in Yemen. Iran has invested zero.


Yemen is also an important front in the war on terror, and has remained so across presidential administrations of both parties. The group now known as Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula launched its first major attack on Americans in October 2000, when its operatives bombed the USS Cole while the destroyer was berthed in Yemen’s Aden harbor. The attack left 17 sailors dead and 39 wounded.


AQAP has since attempted multiple attacks on the U.S. homeland and allied interests, from Nigerian terrorist Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab’s attempted bombing of Northwest Airlines Flight 253, en route from Amsterdam to Detroit on Christmas 2009, to the 2015 massacre at Charlie Hebdo’s offices in Paris. ISIS also maintains a presence in Yemen, from which it seeks to attack the U.S. and our allies.


Abandoning or downgrading the U.S.-Saudi alliance would also do nothing to push Riyadh in a better direction at home. Much work remains to be done to guarantee the freedoms for which America and President Trump always stand. Yet the crown prince has moved the country in a reformist direction, from allowing women to drive and attend sporting events, to curbing the religious police and calling for a return to moderate Islam.


The U.S. doesn’t condone the Khashoggi killing, which is fundamentally inconsistent with American values—something I have told the Saudi leadership privately as well as publicly. President Trump has taken action in response. Twenty-one Saudi suspects in the murder have been deemed ineligible to enter the U.S. and had any visas revoked. On Nov. 15, the administration imposed sanctions on 17 Saudis under Executive Order 13818, which builds on the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act. We’ve worked to strengthen support for this response, and several countries, including France and Germany, have followed suit. The Trump administration will consider further punitive measures if more facts about Khashoggi’s murder come to light.


Critics of the U.S.-Saudi alliance would do well to revisit Jeane Kirkpatrick’s seminal 1979 essay, “Dictatorships and Double Standards,” which analyzed the Carter administration’s failure to distinguish between autocrats friendly to U.S. interests and those who are implacably opposed. Mr. Carter’s ideological predilections had blinded him to U.S. national-security interests and inhibited him, to borrow a phrase, from putting America first.


“Liberal idealism,” Kirkpatrick observed, “need not be identical with masochism, and need not be incompatible with the defense of freedom and the national interest.” What a timely reminder for critics of President Trump’s pragmatic—and correct—approach to the U.S.-Saudi relationship today.

Iranian President Rouhani has once again called for the destruction of Israel. He referred to it as a “cancerous tumor” and a “fake regime.” Such statements inflame tensions in the region by seemingly calling for war. At an international conference on Islamic unity, Rouhani also encouraged Muslims worldwide to unite against the United States. This is a dangerous and irresponsible step that will further deepen Iran’s isolation.


The Iranian regime is no friend of America or Israel when they repeatedly call for the death of millions, including Muslims. The Iranian people know better and do not agree with their government, which has badly represented them to the world for 39 years. The people have suffered under this tyranny for far too long.

We stand with the families and friends of the victims, whose loved ones were lost in this act of barbarism, including six American citizens. The barbarity of 26/11 shocked the entire world.


It is an affront to the families of the victims that, after ten years, those who planned the Mumbai attack have still not been convicted for their involvement. We call upon all countries, particularly Pakistan, to uphold their UN Security Council obligations to implement sanctions against the terrorists responsible for this atrocity, including Lashkar-e-Tayyiba and its affiliates.


The United States is committed to seeing that those responsible for this attack face justice.

QUESTION: Mr. Secretary, new Iran sanctions are in place, eight countries exempted and European countries are staying with the original agreement. What impact do you expect the new sanctions to have in the short term and long term?


SECRETARY POMPEO: The goal is really very clear, George. It is to make sure that we protect America from the threats that the Islamic Republic of Iran presents to folks all across the country and including in Kansas. So these sanctions are intended to convince the Iranian leadership to change their ways, to stop launching missiles into cities where Americans are, to stop building weapon systems that threaten America. That’s our goal is to get the leadership in Iran to change its behavior, to protect Americans wherever they live and wherever they travel.


QUESTION: And these sanctions are targeting the oil production in Iran?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Multiple levels of sanctions. Certainly their oil production, but many other elements of their commercial world as well. We’re trying to do this at the same time that we protect the Iranian people. We’re convinced that the Iranian people don’t want what it is their leaders are bringing them. And so we are doing everything we can to make sure that Iran still has the food and medicine and all of the things that the Iranian people need so that they can make good decisions about their leadership and the actions their leadership will take.


QUESTION: A lot of discussions this week on Saudi Arabia after the murder of Jamal Khashoggi, and I know some senators like Lindsey Graham have disagreed with the President’s assessment of the situation. They’re talking about Congress imposing some sanctions against Saudi Arabia. What’s your reaction to that?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Look, the mission the President set out for the State Department and for the U.S. Government is very clear. We want to make sure that we do everything we can to hold accountable those who committed the murder of Jamal Khashoggi, and do so while still maintaining this incredibly important relationship with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. They provide a lot of oil that matters to folks in Kansas. They provide help pushing back against Iran. This matters a lot to the people of Kansas.


Senator Graham and I both share that concern about Iran and I’m very confident we will continue to work together to keep America safe from Iran. But different members of the Senate will have different views. We’re happy to consider them, and the President said if they bring legislation, he’d be happy to take a look at it. And if it makes sense, if it furthers the interests of America and keeps folks in Wichita, folks in Kansas City, folks in small towns throughout Kansas safe, then the President will be happy to support it.


QUESTION: Have you had any contacts from members of Congress on this?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Oh yes, we’ve been talking to Congress about the issues of Saudi Arabia since I became the Secretary of State, not only issues around the murder of Jamal Khashoggi, and we’ve – I’ve talked to a number of members about that – but the broader set of issues in our relationship, the good work they do providing support to the young men and women who choose to serve in our armed forces who are from Kansas. The Saudis have been an important partner of the United States, helping us do whatever we can to create stability in the Middle East, which is good for American business and Kansas businesses as well.


QUESTION: Can you talk about the working group that has been set up by the U.S. and South Korea on dealings with North Korea?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Yes. That – it’s important as we work to denuclearize North Korea, as we work to fulfill the promises that were made between President Trump and Chairman Kim, there are lots of elements to them. One of them is the relationship between South Korea and North Korea, and the working group is designed to make sure that that effort, that effort to restore peace on the peninsula, moves in parallel with the denuclearization discussions. We are in lock step with our Republic of Korea partners and we want to make sure we stay that way.


QUESTION: So it’s really two issues that are being discussed here, the working group with South Korea, making sure you’re working together, relations between the North and South, and then also the denuclearization.


SECRETARY POMPEO: That’s right. Yes, sir, that’s exactly correct.


QUESTION: Of course, some strong statements recently from North Korea, talk about new tactical weapons they have. What are the next steps on that front?


SECRETARY POMPEO: So we think we know what it is they’re referring to there; we’re pretty sure. I can’t say much. Know this: We’ve known this was going to be a lengthy process. This administration came in with a very difficult risk from North Korea. The President made the decision to have a summit with Chairman Kim, and I’ve been tasked with negotiating its resolution. It will take time. We are prepared to be patient, but all the while – all the while that we’re working to make sure that North Korea has continued to stop its missile tests, continued to stop its nuclear tests, the economic sanctions which have caused North Korea to engage with us will remain in place.


QUESTION: And do you have a special message for the people of Kansas for the Thanksgiving holiday weekend?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Just a Happy Thanksgiving. Susan and I wanted to say thanks for all the people of Kansas have done for us. We miss them and we hope to be back there when our time of service is complete.


QUESTION: Okay. Mr. Secretary, I think that will cover us.

QUESTION: Welcome back in to “The Voice of Reason.” Thirty-two minutes past the hour. A little bit different than how our bottom-of-the-hour news goes, but I’m really excited and honored to have him on the show. I know he’s got limited time to be on the program, but we’re absolutely honored and thrilled to have him on here, especially on a local market, but he’s our former congressman for the 4th Congressional District. He is former director of the CIA and he is currently U.S. Secretary of State. Mr. Mike Pompeo is on the line with us here.


Mr. Secretary, what an honor to have you on the show, my friend. How you doing?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Andy, it’s great to be back with you. I hope you’re doing well. It’s wonderful to be on the show.


QUESTION: I’m doing great. Oh, it is so great to have you back on the show, and I really appreciate you reaching out and wanting to come on here. I have to ask you, so far with – first off, congratulations on everything that you’ve been through and everything that’s going on right now. It is such an honor to have you up there representing us in the way that you are. How are we in – across the world right now? As a representation of the United States, how are we standing among the rest of the world right now?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Andy, I appreciate that, and thanks for the kind words. I appreciate it. Susan and I miss Wichita, we miss Kansas, we miss our Shockers.


QUESTION: Yeah.


SECRETARY POMPEO: But we have been incredibly privileged to get this opportunity to serve in President Trump’s administration, and frankly, in these now – goodness – coming up on two years of this administration, America is in a better place. It’s more secure today than it was when we took office, whether it’s the work that we’ve done to try and reduce the threat in North Korea or the work that we’ve done to try and create a better set of conditions in the Middle East and tamp down and respond to the threat from Iran. All across the world, America is respected in ways that I think are due in large part to the good work that President Trump and his team have done.


QUESTION: That’s really funny, because the media doesn’t report it that way. (Laughter.)


SECRETARY POMPEO: Well, Andy, one does their work, one goes about their mission, and time will judge the caliber of the work that was completed. I’m confident that history will reflect well on the work that we have accomplished.


QUESTION: Absolutely. Well, again, we feel safe with knowing what you’ve done, I mean, from CIA director and the security that you brought there to now Secretary of State. I mean, the very first job and the mission that you had – I mean, you were already over across the world, meeting with the president of North Korea, with Kim Jong-un, or as Donald Trump likes to say at times, “Little Rocket Man,” which I found quite comical. How are the conversations going over there right now?


SECRETARY POMPEO: So progress is being made. It’s going to be a long set of discussions. It’s a very complicated issue. But our mission is very clear here at the State Department. It is to deliver for the President on the commitments that he made and that Chairman Kim made. And when I saw Chairman Kim last – it’s been now a handful of weeks – he continues to make the commitment to allowing verification of the denuclearization of his country, and we, in turn, have continued to make the commitment that we will provide a better future for the people of North Korea. That is, the world will join together and allow a brighter future for that country and its people.


It’s going to be a long road, but while we’re doing that the American people should rest assured. We haven’t had a missile test; we haven’t had a nuclear test; we’ve managed to get the remains of U.S. service members who’d been killed on the peninsula returned. For those families, that is a big deal and for our country, that’s a big deal too.


QUESTION: It is something that’s been tried for so long and it’s never happened, and yet it seems to be happening now. We’re on the right path. I know it’s going to be a rocky road. Is there a timeframe for any of this or is it just kind of we take it day by day right now?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Well, it’s – there’s no timeframe. We don’t want to set a date certain. But it’s more than day by day in the sense that there is a plan. There is an understanding about how it is we hope that we can proceed. But that framework is still being built out and discussions continue.


QUESTION: Absolutely. Real quick, I know that you’re short on time but we’ve got to ask as well. The big news has been lately in Saudi Arabia with the journalist and President Trump has talked about our relationship with Saudi Arabia. What is our position right now and what’s the latest in that situation?


SECRETARY POMPEO: President Trump’s been very clear, as have I. The murder of Jamal Khashoggi is a heinous act that’s terrible and the United States has already acted to hold senior officials in Saudi Arabia accountable – 17 individuals placed on very, very serious sanctions for their involvement. That is, America has evidence that they were involved and we took action in response to that. But we’re determined to make sure that the American people are safe, and part of that is making sure we have good partners and stability in the Middle East, and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is an important part of that.


They ensure that our soldiers, sailors, airmen, and Marines that are working there are well taken care of. They’ve worked with us diligently to push back against the world’s largest state sponsor of terror in Iran. I could go on. The list of places where we have worked together is long. And frankly, during our time in office Saudi Arabia has moved forward on important human rights issues as well. These are all good things, and most importantly, all good things for the American people, which President Trump always puts at the top of his list.


QUESTION: Sure. Well, and our allies have always been important to us, and as we try and curb the way the world acts at times when it comes to human rights issues and other problems, that if we’re able to maintain that relationship but yet try to push them and nudge them in the right direction. It seems like we’re going in that right direction. Little by little, but it seems to be going there.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Yeah, that’s right. Look, it is often the case that America can influence human rights issues around the world and put them in a better place. Not every country shares our value set. Our mission statement is to make sure that the American people are safe and secure, and at the same time to do everything that we can that human beings around the world also are treated with the dignity and the way that, frankly, the people of Kansas understand we ought to treat each other.


QUESTION: Absolutely. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. I know that you’re short on time, but any plans to get back here to the Wichita area for the holidays this year?


SECRETARY POMPEO: I’m not going to make it back for the holidays but I am trying to find a Shocker game that fits my schedule, and I’m going to try and sneak on through to get to one. I’m not sure it’ll happen, but Susan and I sure hope that it does.


QUESTION: Well, hopefully, and I know the Shockers actually were up in the White House just a few days ago or a week or so ago and you got to visit them, and they were really shocked that President Trump got to show up as well.


SECRETARY POMPEO: It was really great fun. The President was very generous with his time. And for those young people and the coaches, a chance to be in the Oval Office to meet with the President was truly a lifetime treat. They got to see this incredibly – this incredibly important place in American history, and I think it was a wonderful time and I was thrilled to be able to give them an opportunity to do that.

QUESTION: Let’s do it here on 710 KCMO, and welcome in the Secretary of State, that is Mike Pompeo, joining us here on the line. And, Mr. Secretary, we appreciate a few minutes. I know it’s a busy time; it’s always a busy time for you, but --


SECRETARY POMPEO: Pete, good morning. It’s good to talk to you.


QUESTION: Good to have you on. We appreciate it. Well, let’s start off with what’s going on here with the Khashoggi murder. President comes out; he’s received some criticism for his handling of this. He said it’s all about an “America first” policy. There appears to be some pushback in the Republican Party, Lindsey Graham and some others saying at the very least we have to look into sanctions. What do you think the best way to handle the Saudis in the wake of this CIA report as well?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Well, we’ve been very clear. We’re going to hold those who conducted this murder accountable. We’ve already done so. We’ve sanctioned 17 people, some of them very senior in the Saudi government. We are going to make sure that America always stands for human rights. We’ve watched the Saudis actually move in that direction during our time in office as well. It’s not an unblemished record, but there certainly have been steps forward.


And President Trump has made clear since he began to run for office that the most important thing for him was to ensure that America was successful and that we protected the American people. And the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has been an important national security partner to the United States, pushing back against the murderous regime in Iran that actually presents real risk to the American people, and we are determined to make sure that the relationship between the United States and Saudi Arabia stays strong so that we can protect America.


QUESTION: So, Mr. Secretary, what’s your – what’s your response then to Lindsey Graham and his ilk that say that we have strong and we will have strong bipartisan support for serious – or more serious sanctions than what you’re talking about? How are you going to ease his concerns and others like him in the Republican Party?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Well, the President is happy to consider whatever members of Congress share with him or legislation that’s presented to him, and I think the President was very clear in his statement yesterday. To the extent they have good ideas that further American national security, this administration will be happy to support them.


QUESTION: Secretary of State Mike Pompeo joining us here on 710 KCMO. Pete Mundo with you. Mr. Secretary, let’s dive into North Korea. Obviously, some rumblings about maybe an early-2019 meeting, another summit between Kim Jong-un and President Trump. Where do we stand on that relationship and what might be next between these two countries?


SECRETARY POMPEO: This has been an incredibly important part of President Trump’s foreign policy agenda. Among the greatest risks to the American people when we took office was the capacity of North Korea to fire missiles that would be incredibly destructive to the United States. We now have got the North Koreans not conducting missile tests. They’ve not conducted a nuclear test in a long time. We continue to negotiate with them to get them to implement what Chairman Kim, who I’ve had the chance to meet with on a number of occasions, to get Chairman Kim to complete the commitment that he made to fully and verifiably denuclearize North Korea. This would be great for America, great for the region, and wonderful for the North Korean people as well, and I do hope that there’ll be a summit between the two leaders early in 2019.


QUESTION: Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is with us. So let’s get into something. Obviously, you represented the state of Kansas in Congress, and now, being the Secretary of State, a lot of what you do, people say it’s just so confusing to me. So for the average Kansan, for the average Missourian like us, we’re sitting here, we’re following you, we’re seeing you on TV, hearing you on the radio. What you’re doing day to day, how does that have an effect on our day-to-day lives?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Yeah, it’s a great question. So I did; I had the privilege to represent southcentral Kansas for a handful of years. It was a wonderful time and I hope I served Kansans well. Today our mission set as I run the world’s finest diplomatic corps is to deliver for the American people a set of outcomes with our allies that keep Americans safe, whether that’s work that we’re doing along our southern border, work we’re doing in the Middle East to ensure there’s stability in the Middle East, building our relationships with partners, working in Asia. These places all present risk to the American people and our continued welfare and capacity to grow our economy so that families in Kansas can live the lives that they want to, and that’s our task.


And I guess I’d add to this we also have a lot of folks from Kansas who choose to serve in our armed forces. The State Department’s role is to make sure that we need to use them, to put those young men and women in harm’s way just as little as is humanly possible while keeping America safe.


QUESTION: Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is with us. Well, Mr. Secretary, appreciate a few minutes. Big Thanksgiving plans or are you going to be – a chance to take it easy here?


SECRETARY POMPEO: I’m going to get at least a day, I hope, if the world permits.

SECRETARY POMPEO: Good afternoon, everyone. Happy Thanksgiving.


I want to touch on five topics today. First, the United States today sanctioned an international network that the Iranian regime and Russia are using to provide millions of barrels of oil to the Assad regime. This is in exchange for the movement of hundreds of millions of dollars to the IRGC Quds Force. That money is then passed on to terrorist organizations like Hizballah and Hamas. The United States in its continued efforts will not allow these dirty dealings to flourish. Iran will not be allowed to exploit the international financial system, to hide revenue streams it uses to fund terrorist activity, support sectarian militias, abusing civilian populations, or to destabilize the region.


Second, you’ve seen that Interpol is electing a new president. It’s an important organization. We strongly endorse Kim Jong Yang, who is serving as its acting president. We encourage all nations and organizations that are part of Interpol and that respect the rule of law to choose a leader with credibility and integrity that reflects one of the world’s most critical law enforcement bodies. We believe Mr. Kim will be just that.


Third, our Special Representative for Afghanistan Reconciliation Zalmay Khalilzad just got back from his trip to Afghanistan, the UAE, and Qatar. Ambassador Khalilzad’s first and last stop was Kabul, where he met with President Ghani, Chief Executive Abdullah, and other Afghan stakeholders to facilitate a peace process between the Government of Afghanistan and the Taliban. During this visit to Kabul, Ambassador Khalilzad met with men and women active in Afghan civil society and peace efforts, members of the media, and other governmental and nongovernmental organizations. In every one of his meetings, Ambassador Khalilzad stressed that all Afghans must have a say in creating a sustainable peace for Afghanistan. We will continue to work with all interested parties to support and facilitate an inclusive peace process.


Fourth, our Special Representative for North Korea Steve Biegun is meeting today with his Republic of Korea counterpart to further strengthen our close coordination on efforts to achieve our shared goal of the final, fully verified denuclearization, as agreed to by Chairman Kim. These are important discussions today with the Republic of Korea. They are discussing ongoing diplomatic efforts, our sustained implementation of UN sanctions, and the inter-Korean cooperation.


And finally, I just left a meeting with Turkish Foreign Minister Cavusoglu today. I welcomed the positive momentum in our relationship following the release of Pastor Brunson and urged reopening additional channels to address issues of mutual concern. We are still greatly concerned about Turkey’s continued unjust detention of U.S. locally employed staff and citizens, including NASA scientist Serkan Golge. We also discussed the Khashoggi case and the need to work together to de-escalate conflict in Syria, support the reinvigoration of the UN-led peace process, and achieve a peaceful, lasting solution to the Syrian conflict.


With that, I’m happy to take a few questions.


MS NAUERT: I’ll call on questions. Abbie from NBC, please, go right ahead.


QUESTION: Sure. Mr. Secretary, one of the things that the President points to in his statement is a $110 billion arms initiative. But by the State Department’s own record in October, only 14.5 billion has come through. When do you expect to see the rest of the money from that arms agreement?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Some of these contracts, defense contracts in particular, are complex, lengthy contract negotiations. We are working diligently on the remainder of those. We actually hope that number will end up being even greater. I couldn’t tell you when those negotiations will conclude, but we are very hopeful that each of those commitments that the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia made to the United States to purchase equipment will be completed in a timely fashion.


MS NAUERT: Michel, with Al Hurra.


QUESTION: Yes, and thank you so much. Mr. Secretary, based on the President’s statement, moving forward, the relations with Saudi Arabia won’t be affected by the killing of Jamal Khashoggi? And how can you differentiate between the kingdom and the crown prince?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Yeah. So it’s a mean, nasty world out there, the Middle East in particular. There are important American interests, to keep the American people safe, to protect Americans – not only Americans who are here, but Americans who are traveling and working, doing business in the Middle East. It is the President’s obligation – indeed, the State Department’s duty as well – to ensure that we adopt policies that further America’s national security.


So as the President said today, the United States will continue to have a relationship with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. They are an important partner of ours. We will do that with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, its people. That is the commitment that the President made today. It’s that straightforward.


By the way, this is a long, historic commitment, and one that is absolutely vital to America’s national security. We are determined to ensure that we continue to make sure that we take care of the American people in all of the strategic decisions we make about with whom we work around the world.


MS NAUERT: Michele with NPR.


QUESTION: So one quick follow-up on that, and then a question on Iran. So does the “America first” agenda mean putting U.S. business interests ahead of human rights concerns? And then on Iran, have you considered any specific actions, specific sanctions, to pressure Iran to release the American citizens who are held there?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Let me try taking your second question first.


QUESTION: Yep.


SECRETARY POMPEO: We are engaged every day, literally every day, in working to return every U.S. citizen who is either wrongfully detained or a hostage somewhere around the world. That certainly includes Bob Levinson and all those that are being held by the Iranian regime. We are determined to get them back. As President Trump has made very clear, we’re not going to pay a price for their return, but we are prepared to work with all those who can assist us in getting those Americans returned to their families and returned here to our country.


Your other question is best answered by talking about what we have already done. There has been an enormous effort with respect to fact-finding pertaining to the death, the murder, of Jamal Khashoggi. A lot of U.S. resources have been devoted to determining the facts to the best of our ability to determine precisely what happened there.


The United States took a very strong response. We have sanctioned 17 individuals in connection with that investigation. We are at the same time committed to making sure that we place America’s national security interests and all the actions that take place in the context of doing the right thing to make sure that America continues to thrive and grow. And when we do that, the world is better off for it too, and the Middle East is better off as well.


MS NAUERT: Ben from NHK.


QUESTION: Yeah, you mentioned Steve Biegun’s meeting with his South Korean counterpart. I just wanted to ask: What’s the message he’s going to be sending as far as what the U.S. Government would like to see the South Korean Government do as far as coordinating their inter-Korean efforts and the denuclearization efforts?


SECRETARY POMPEO: So I think there’s complete agreement between the South Koreans and us with respect to how this should proceed. We now have a working group that formalizes those processes so that we can be sure that we don’t talk past each other, that we don’t take an action or the South Koreans don’t take an action that the other is unaware of or hasn’t had a chance to comment on or provide their thoughts. And that’s the purpose of the working group that’s being led on our side by Stephen Biegun.


We have made clear to the Republic of Korea that we do want to make sure that peace on the peninsula and the denuclearization of North Korea aren’t lagging behind the increase in the amount of inter-relationship between the two Koreas. We view them as tandem, as moving forward together. We view them as important parallel processes, and that working group is designed to make sure they continue to remain that way.


MS NAUERT: And a final question, CNN.


QUESTION: Hi. Secretary Pompeo, you mentioned you’re gathering all these facts. Does the President’s statement today mean that that fact-finding segment is over, and have you seen the assessment he is expected to get today?


SECRETARY POMPEO: I can’t comment on intelligence matters. I’d direct you to the – to the DNI Director Coats or to the CIA to talk about particular intelligence issues. Facts will obviously still continue to come to light. I’m confident of that. It’s the way the world works.


QUESTION: And as these facts come to light, will you pursue further actions against whoever, even if it does show culpability of --


SECRETARY POMPEO: We have been unambiguous with respect to how we have treated the data set that we have been able to get. When America has the information it needs, it will, of course, do the right thing to protect American interests. And we have done so every time.


MS NAUERT: Thank you, everybody.

On behalf of the United States government, I wish to congratulate Latvia and its people on their centennial anniversary of independence.


We have enjoyed celebrating this special anniversary with you throughout 2018. We were particularly proud to host President Raimonds Vejonis and the presidents of Estonia and Lithuania at the White House in April for the U.S.-Baltic Centennial Summit and the U.S.-Baltic Business Forum. As President Trump noted, the Summit is a testament to the deep and lasting friendship between our countries.


We also welcomed performances by Latvian artists at the Kennedy Center, the Library of Congress, and Dupont Circle in Washington, DC. These celebrations in our nation’s capital were especially meaningful given that throughout the brutal Soviet occupation, the United States never ceased to recognize the sovereignty of Latvia.


Congratulations once again on your centennial and we look forward to the next 100 years of prosperity and growth in our U.S.-Latvian relationship.

SECRETARY POMPEO: Good afternoon, everyone. It’s my honor today to welcome Minister Klimkin to Washington to breathe new life into the U.S.-Ukraine Strategic Partnership Commission and to reaffirm our unwavering support for a democratic Ukraine. It’s good to see you again. I saw you in Paris; it’s wonderful to spend some time with you again today, and I know you had a series of very productive meetings with our team as well.


Ten years ago, we initiated this dialogue to advance our mutual interests and grow our bonds as free nations. Today, we achieved progress on three pillars of the relationship, and I’ll talk about each of them. First, security and countering Russian aggression; second, the rule of law and humanitarian issues; and finally, economic and energy security. We’re bolstering Ukrainian democracy, growing prosperity, and better equipping Ukraine to counter Russia’s aggressive designs on that country.


Ukraine is at a critical point in history. During the 2014 Revolution of Dignity, the Ukrainian people sacrificed their lives to protect their independence and self-determination. They demanded that their government maintain Ukraine’s European orientation and end pervasive corruption.


Ukrainians continue to fight this battle as they work to build a modern, democratic, Western state.


They know that a free and well-governed nation is a hard-won victory, but it’s worth it. The United States supports those efforts and honors the achievements that you have made thus far.


That same spirit of courage and determination drives Ukrainians to continue to fight to uphold their national sovereignty and territorial integrity in the face of Russian aggression. Ukraine has no greater friend than the United States in this regard.


As we made clear in the Crimea Declaration this past summer, the United States will never accept Russia’s attempted annexation of Crimea. We will continue to impose consequences against Russia until Moscow fully implements the Minsk agreements and returns control of Crimea to Ukraine. As a show of our resolve, just last week we imposed a new round of sanctions on the supporters of Russian aggression in Ukraine.


Our dialogue today also included important discussions on the rule of law, anticorruption, relations with neighbors, and human rights. We explored how we can work together to promote democratic principles, press freedom, and judicial independence. These are all staples of a thriving, free society.


Advancing these crucial reform goals will ensure the ideals of the Revolution of Dignity are permanently woven into the fabric of a democratic Ukraine.


By strengthening your political institutions, these reforms will also make Ukraine more resilient in the face of Russian aggression.


And finally, we had a chance today to discuss energy security and economic reforms. We’ll keep working together to stop the Nord Stream 2 project that undermines Ukraine’s economic and strategic security and risks further compromising the sovereignty of European nations that depend on Russian gas.


We do not want our European friends to fall prey to the kind of political and economic manipulation Russia has attempted in Ukraine since it cast off its Soviet shackles.


Foreign Minister, thank you for being here today.


FOREIGN MINISTER KLIMKIN: Secretary Pompeo, dear friends, I am very glad to come to Washington to meet with you and to launch together the work of our Strategic Partnership Commission. Thanks again, Mike, for the invitation. It’s a pleasure to be here.


This year marks the 10th anniversary of the U.S.-Ukraine Charter on Strategic Partnership. The commission unites a number of ministers and governmental agencies on both sides – such as defense, commerce, energy, foreign affairs – that work together to advance our broad and intensive agenda, and the shared goals enumerated in the charter.


We’ve had a very good and productive discussion today on the whole range of issues that both our countries work on. I would like to stress that our strategic partnership is based on the common values that our two countries share. And today’s meeting showed once again that Ukraine and the United States have become real allies and friends. Today our countries stand shoulder to shoulder in countering Russia’s aggression. This aggression takes many forms. It’s the hot war in Ukraine, where Russia occupied Crimea and parts of Donbas, the war that took off over 11,000 people, the war which continued this very moment in the very heart of Europe.


It also takes the form of trying to undermine democratic institutions in the U.S. and in Europe, including Ukraine. With presidential and parliamentary elections coming up into Ukraine, we are looking at U.S. experience in countering Russia’s election meddling, as well as sharing with the U.S. our experience in dealing with this risk. We share the peace through strength approach, and appreciate the U.S. leadership showing the strength in the face of Russian malign behavior.


I would like to especially thank Secretary Pompeo once again for the Crimea Declaration, which was a demonstration of exactly such leadership and strength. We must not falter in the face of the aggressor, and pressure and the sanctions must remain in place until Moscow changes its course. However, so far we don’t see any change. On the contrary, we see Russia’s subversive activities in the Sea of Azov. We see shellings of our land and lives being lost every day. We see Ukrainian citizens held as political prisoners in Russian jails. And today, we discussed ways how Ukraine and the U.S. will continue to work together to strengthen our resilience.


We appreciate the U.S. support in strengthening our defense capabilities, both through training of our military and through providing defense equipment. As partners on those Budapest memorandums, thereby, Ukraine gave up the third largest nuclear arsenal in the world – the memorandum blatantly violated by Russia – we will continue to further develop our security and defense cooperation.


We will also continue to focus including in the framework for the Strategic Partnership Commission on strengthening, as the Secretary has just said, the rule of law in Ukraine; eradicating corruption, which is our most fundamental challenge aside from countering Russia's aggression; and further support of our civil society.


We are thankful for U.S. support of Ukraine's steady progress towards eventual membership in NATO and the European Union, and we appreciate the U.S. support and understandings that today Ukraine is defending not only territorial but also spiritual independence. So thank you again for the support of our spiritual independence and to create autocephaly of the Ukrainian Church.


We have also talked today about further expanding and giving a boost to our trade and investment as well as actual cooperation. Our trade increased 1.6 times over the past year. We can think about new ideas in this field such as exploring the possibility of a free trade area in the future.


Thanks, again, Mike for this invitation. Thank you for your very strong personal support. I look forward to welcoming you in Ukraine for the next round of our Strategic Partnership Commission in not-too-distant future. Thanks a lot.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Thank you. Wonderful to see you. Great, thank you.

Today, the United States imposed sanctions on seventeen Saudi Arabian individuals for serious human rights abuse resulting from their roles in the killing of Jamal Khashoggi at the Consulate of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in Istanbul, Turkey, on October 2. This action was taken under the authority of Executive Order 13818, which implements and builds upon the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act. As a result of this action, all of these individuals’ assets within U.S. jurisdiction are blocked, and U.S. persons are generally prohibited from engaging in transactions with them. At the time of Khashoggi’s killing, these individuals occupied positions in the Royal Court and several ministries and offices of the Government of Saudi Arabia.


List of Sanctioned Individuals


The Global Magnitsky Act empowers the United States to take significant steps to protect and promote human rights and combat corruption around the world.


Our action today is an important step in responding to Khashoggi’s killing. The State Department will continue to seek all relevant facts, consult Congress, and work with other nations to hold accountable those involved in the killing of Jamal Khashoggi.

In order to further optimize the State Department and USAID’s humanitarian assistance, I have established a new senior-level mechanism for coordinating and overseeing U.S. humanitarian assistance – the Humanitarian Assistance Steering Council. The purpose of the Council is to coordinate U.S. government efforts in order to achieve seamless, efficient, and effective delivery of humanitarian assistance overseas in support of U.S. foreign policy objectives, including promoting burden-sharing and UN humanitarian reform.


The State Department, through the Bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration, as well as USAID, through the Bureau of Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance, have vital and complementary roles to play in the development and implementation of U.S. humanitarian assistance. The Council’s establishment will improve oversight and accountability across the two organizations while supporting their distinct and important functions.


Ambassador Nathan A. Sales, with his delegated authorities of the Under Secretary for Civilian Security, Democracy, and Human Rights, and Rear Admiral Tim Ziemer, head of the Bureau of Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance, will co-lead the Council at the outset. Other members will include senior leaders from the Bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration, the Office of U.S. Foreign Assistance Resources, the Bureau of International Organization Affairs, and USAID’s Bureau for Policy, Planning, and Learning.


The Council will provide important leadership and coordination to maintain the United States’ proud tradition of responding to conflicts, other complex emergencies, and natural disasters while equipping the United States to improve the impact and results of our humanitarian assistance. Promoting burden-sharing by other donors will be an important focus for the Council. Despite significant U.S. and other donor contributions, the gap between needs and available resources continues to grow, which is why it is critical that we redouble our efforts to improve efficiency and increase donor contributions in order to promote sustainable solutions for those in need.

SECRETARY POMPEO: Good afternoon, everyone. Secretary Mattis and I are pleased to welcome Director Yang and Minister Wei to the State Department for the second U.S.-China Diplomatic & Security Dialogue. Welcome.


	Presidents Trump and Xi launched this dialogue as a venue for candid discussions on issues affecting the U.S.-China relationship, and we advanced these discussions today in preparation for the upcoming meeting between our two leaders at the G20.


	As President Trump has made clear, the United States seeks a constructive, results-oriented relationship with China grounded in fairness, reciprocity, and respect. Personal relationships of trust and candor will go a long way in achieving these ends.


	This is why I was truly pleased to engage in friendly, constructive dialogue with Director Yang and Minister Wei today on a host of opportunities and challenges between our two countries.


	Even as our countries confront important differences in the bilateral relationship between the nations, our cooperation remains essential on many, many central issues. For example, I expressed in our meeting today the importance of remaining united in the pursuit of the final, fully verified denuclearization of North Korea as agreed to be Chairman Kim in Singapore. This means maintaining pressure through the continued strict enforcement of all UN Security Council resolutions.


	China’s cooperation in enforcing those UN Security Council resolutions will help achieve meaningful breakthroughs on this important denuclearization issue.


	I also expressed our desire to see further cooperation from China in addressing Iran’s nuclear missile programs and other malign activities. We hope to work with the Chinese Government and Chinese energy companies in this regard. Bringing Iran’s oil export revenues to zero is a critical component of this campaign, and we discussed this today.


	We also discussed how we can strengthen the commitments made at last year’s dialogue, including deepening bilateral exchanges on military and security issues and risk reduction in times of crisis.


	In addition to these opportunities to strengthen our cooperation, I was forthright in addressing significant differences between our nations.


	I was clear, for example, that we have continued concern about China’s activities and militarization in the South China Sea. We pressed China to live up to its past commitments in this area.


	Regarding our strong ties with a democratic Taiwan, I reiterated the U.S. policy has not changed and that we are concerned about China’s increasing efforts to coerce others, constraining Taiwan’s international space. And finally, I stated the United States and the international communities will continue to express our concerns with respect to China’s repression of religious groups – Christian, Buddhists, and 800,000 to possibly millions of Muslims that have been denied their freedoms.


	In closing, I want to state that this was an incredibly productive conversation. The United States is not pursuing a Cold War or containment policy with China.


	Rather, we want to ensure that China acts responsibly and fairly in support of security and prosperity of each of our two countries.


	I hope that our discussions today as well as the upcoming discussions between Presidents Trump and Xi will yield tangible results towards this goal. I am confident that they will.


	Thank you. And I’d now like to invite Director Yang to make his statement. Thank you, sir.


POLITBURO MEMBER YANG: (Via interpreter) Dear friends from the press, ladies and gentlemen, good afternoon. State Councilor and Defense Minister Wei Fenghe and I are very delighted to come to Washington, D.C. and co-chair together with Secretary of State Pompeo and Secretary of Defense General Mattis for the second round of Diplomatic & Security Dialogue.


	Let me first thank our U.S. host for their gracious hospitality. This morning, centering on the summit between President Xi and President Trump during the G20 summit in Argentina in November, we had an in-depth discussion, and we have had full communication on China-U.S. bilateral relationship and major international regional issues of shared interest. The dialogue is candid, constructive, and productive.


	We highly commend the strategic guidance of summit diplomacy for China-U.S. relations, and we believe that under the current circumstances the meeting between our two presidents is of great importance to maintaining the steady and healthy development of China-U.S. relations. We agree to act upon the phone call of the two presidents on November the 1st to step up communication and coordination and make good preparations for the summit to ensure its positive outcomes.


	We also elaborate on our respective strategic intentions and domestic and foreign policies. The Chinese side stresses that China is firm on pursuing socialist – socialism with Chinese characteristics. Everything that we do is to deliver a better life for the Chinese people, to realize rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. It is not intended to challenge or displease anyone. China will stay on the course of reform and opening up and a path of peaceful development. And we are committed to working with other countries for a community with a shared future for mankind.


	China will remain a contributor to world peace and global development, as well as a defender of the international order. China has all along committed itself to working with the United States for non-confrontation, non-conflict, mutual respect, and win-win outcome, and to make positive contribution to peace, stability, and prosperity in the Asia Pacific and beyond.


	We believe that as the top two economies in the world, the largest developing country and developed country, a healthy and steady growth of China-U.S. relations is in the best interest of the two peoples and people of the world. It is also the shared desire of the two peoples. The two sides will follow the direction and principles set out by the two president, manage differences with mutual respect, and expand cooperation in a mutually beneficial manner and work together to pursue a China-U.S. relationship that is characterized by coordination and cooperation.


	The two sides agree to handle differences and sensitive issues in a constructive manner. China reaffirmed its position on economic and trade issues. The two sides agree to follow up on the consensus reached by the two presidents in their latest phone call, to support the two economic teams, to step up engagement and pursue consultation on issues of mutual concerns, and to seek a mutually acceptable solution.


	The Chinese side highlights that China is firmly resolved to safeguard its sovereignty and territorial integrity. The “one China” principle is the political foundation for China-U.S. relations. Taiwan independent forces and their separatist activities pose the biggest threat to peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait. The U.S. should recognize it clearly. We urge the United States to abide by the “one China” principle and the three China-U.S. joint communiques and cautiously handle Taiwan-related matters.


	The Chinese side also stressed that proper handling of the Middle East situation, in particular matters related to Iran, is very important. About the deal on Iran, it needs to be continued to be implemented and observed to – and the two sides should make – contribute – make continued contribution to peace and stability of the region.


	The Chinese side is committed to peace and development in the Asia Pacific. We respect the United States interest in the Asia Pacific. At the same time, we expect the United States to respect China’s security interests in the Asia Pacific, China’s sovereignty and development interests. China has undertaken some constructions on its islands and reefs. Most of them are civilian facilities. The purpose is to serve the interest of the Chinese people and also to provide public goods to others.


	At the same time, it is necessary for China to build certain security facilities in response to possible threats from outside. We believe that no country should use any excuse to engage in militarization in the region. Actually, to pursue militarization in the region will not only undermine interest of regional countries, but will hurt the countries who take these actions themselves. There’s no such a problem of the freedom of navigation and overflight being obstructed, so to use the freedom of navigation and overflight as an excuse to pursue military actions is unjustifiable.


	China respects human rights as other countries must do the same. As President Xi points out, there is always room for improvement on human rights. In China, people have the freedom to believe or not believe in religion. They are all Chinese citizens. Their human rights have been fully respected and protected. It is our hope that the United States could respect the fact. All in all, China and the United States should step up communication on the basis of mutual respect and work to handle well its own affairs.


	We believe that the strategic guidance provided by our two presidents is very important, and we need to follow up on the consensus that they have reached and further expand areas for cooperation – potential for cooperation.


	We agreed to continue to advance communication in mil-to-mil relations, counterterrorism, law enforcement, counternarcotics, and the abuse and smuggling of fentanyl, and also coordination and cooperation in people-to-people exchange and at national levels and on major international regional issues, to better benefit our two peoples and provide more public goods for the world.


	The two sides discussed in an in-depth manner the Korean Peninsula issue. China reaffirmed its position and commitment to denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, peace and stability of the Korean Peninsula, and a solution through consultation and negotiation. China will continue to enforce strictly relevant UN Security Council resolutions. China supports direct dialogue between the United States and the DPRK and hopes that the two sides will meet each other halfway, accommodate each other’s legitimate concerns, build trust, and advance denuclearization process and the establishment of a peace mechanism in tandem.


	The two sides also exchanged views on Afghanistan and other regional and international issues and agreed to step up communication and coordination and play a positive role in seeking proper settlement to relevant issues.


	Ladies and gentlemen, next year marks the 40th anniversary of our diplomatic relations. For the past four decades, China-U.S. relations have been moving forward despite all the twists and turns and have made historic progress and have delivered benefits to both countries and the world. History and reality prove that cooperation is the only right choice for both countries, and win-win can lead to a better life. For the fundamental interest of the two peoples and people in other parts of the world, we hope that our two sides will work in concert and come together, focus on cooperation, manage differences, and advance China-U.S. relations along the right track. Thank you.


SECRETARY MATTIS: Well, good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. And it’s been a pleasure to join Secretary Pompeo in welcoming Director Yang and Minister Wei to Washington for our U.S.-China Diplomatic & Security Dialogue. And we thank you both for making the long trip, along with your delegation, from Beijing.


	Your visit reminds us that we build on a deep history between the United States and China, one that stretches back to the earliest days of our American experiment in democracy. Our meeting today is evidence of America’s efforts to work toward a brighter future for both our peoples. President Trump’s National Security Strategy makes it clear that competition does not mean hostility, nor must it lead to conflict. While our two Pacific nations may not always agree, we recognize it serves both our people’s interests to cooperate where we can.


	High-level dialogues like this help diminish the space between us as we explore areas where we share common interest and common purpose. To that end, as Secretary Pompeo stated, today we discussed our shared desire to achieve the final, fully verified denuclearization of North Korea. We reaffirmed our nation’s commitments to enforcing the unanimous Security Council resolutions in pursuit of that goal for the good of all mankind.


	As the Secretary of State touched on, we also discussed the importance for all military, law enforcement, and civilian vessels and aircraft, including those in the PLA Navy, the Chinese Coast Guard, and the PRC Maritime Militia, to operate in a safe and professional manner, in accordance with international law, as we seek peaceful resolution of all disputes in the South China Sea. Through candid discussions, we sought ways to lessen tension, maintain open lines of communication between our militaries, and reduce the risk of miscalculation. And we made clear that the United States will continue to fly, sail, and operate wherever international law allows.


	The U.S. commitment to a free and open Indo-Pacific, one that is underpinned by the rules-based international order and regional stability, is unwavering. Director Yang, Minister Wei, within our pursuit to realize this vision for the region, I echo Secretary of State Pompeo’s words that the United States seeks a constructive, reciprocal, and results-oriented U.S.-China relationship, one that benefits the Indo-Pacific and the world.


	We continue our commitment to explore new areas of cooperation on strategic issues of mutual concern like space, cyber, and nuclear capabilities, as well as reinforce the importance of military-to-military exchanges for our bilateral relationship. For we recognize our military ties can serve as a source of stability for our two nations as long as we remain transparent and communicate sincerely with one another.


	Along that line, the United States is committed to finalizing a military-to-military crisis deconfliction and communication framework with China while we seek ways to implement and enhance the existing confidence-building measures, including what we call the Joint Staff Dialogue Mechanism.


	Director Yang, Minister Wei, thank you again for coming to Washington today. Minister Wei, I look forward to continuing this morning’s constructive conversation at our bilateral meeting this afternoon. And I now invite you to make your remarks.


STATE COUNCILOR WEI: (Via interpreter) Friends from the press, good morning. It gives me great pleasure to meet with you here in Washington at the invitation of Secretary Mattis for an official visit to the U.S. and also for the second round of Diplomatic & Security Dialogue. I want to thank our host, the Secretary Mattis, for your gracious hospitality to my delegation.


	Just now, the two sides had candid and in-depth discussion on how to follow up on the important common understanding reached between our two presidents. I think this is a productive and positive dialogue. The two sides share the view that the two sides need to further step up strategic trust, properly handle differences, promote exchanges and cooperation, so that this military relationship will be a source of stability for the overall bilateral ties.


	As two major countries, we stand to gain from cooperation and to lose from confrontation. Cooperation is the only option for us. Peaceful coexistence and cooperation between the two militaries will be good news for our two countries and for the whole world, while confrontation or conflict between the two militaries will spell disaster to all.


	China is committed to peaceful development. It follows a defense policy that is defensive in nature. We will definitely not seek hegemony however strong we may grow. The development of China’s defense capability represents a growing force for world peace. The Chinese military stands firmly against any separatist activities. We have an unwavering resolve in safeguarding China’s sovereignty, security, and development interests.


	China always approaches its mil-to-mil relationship with the U.S. with utmost sincerity and would likewise expect the U.S. to respect China’s core interests and major concerns so that the two sides can work toward the same goal and achieve a relationship defined by no conflict, no confrontation, mutual respect, and willing cooperation, and contribute our part to peace and stability in our region and beyond.


	Thank you.


MR PALLADINO: Thank you. We now have time for four reporters to ask questions. We will call on reporters, and we ask that each reporter limit their question to one. For the first question, I would like to call on the Voice of America, Ms. Nike Ching.


QUESTION: Thank you very much. Good morning. Secretary Pompeo and Mattis, on South China Sea, what are specific things the U.S. and China are doing to build up military mechanism to avoid conflict, and if there are operational changes?


	Mr. Secretary, how were Uighur and Taiwan issues being discussed during your meeting with the Chinese counterparts? What is the U.S. asking for? Is strengthening U.S.-China – is strengthening U.S.-Taiwan ties an irritant in U.S.-China relations?


	(Via interpreter) Director Yang, the world at large has expressed concerns over the human rights situation in Tibet and Xinjiang. The Chinese Government has said it opposes interference into domestic affairs of China. But is China ready to invite and facilitate visits by U.S. officers and officials to visit those areas?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Did you want to go first?


SECRETARY MATTIS: Sure. In regards to our exercises and operations in the South China Sea, the United States adheres strictly to international law and the international maritime rules of the road, and we continue to operate anywhere in international waters, international air space, as all nations are entitled to. So the most important thing is that we all pay equal attention to international law.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Your question to me was with respect to Taiwan and the issue with the Uighur population. The U.S. policy has not changed since this administration took office with respect to Taiwan; we honor the “one China” policy and the three communiques. Every action that we have taken is consistent with that, and we will continue to take actions that are consistent with honoring that commitment that is a longstanding United States commitment.


	And the United States is also unequivocal when it comes to human rights. We ask every country, China included – we have discussions to make sure that they treat the people of their nations with the respect and dignity that every human being is entitled to. And when it comes to religious minorities in China, we had a conversation about how it is that we hope the Chinese will treat their religious minorities and our concerns with respect to that. It was a good conversation and one that is important to each of our two countries, I know.


POLITBURO MEMBER YANG: In my opening remarks, I said that in our discussion we talked about the issue of the South China Sea. China reaffirmed its principled position on this issue and pointed out that China has indisputable sovereignty over islands in Nansha and its adjacent waters. On its own territory, China is undertaking some constructions to build civilian facilities and necessary defense facilities. That is the right of preservations and self-defense that international law has provided for sovereign state that has nothing to do with militarization. They are legitimate. China is committed to addressing disputes through dialogue and negotiation with parties directly concerned. China is working with ASEAN countries to fully implement, fully and comprehensively, the DOC, and the consultation now COC is making good progress. Well, right now the situation in the South China Sea is trending toward greater stability.


	In our discussion just now, the Chinese side made it clear to the United States that it should stop sending its vessels and military aircraft close to Chinese islands and reefs and stop actions that undermine China’s sovereignty and security interest. And we urge the United States to play constructive role for peace and stability in the South China Sea. That will certainly help reduce security risks.


	Taiwan is an inalienable part of the Chinese territory. On the basis of the “one China” principle. China has established diplomatic relations with over 170 countries. We will continue to remain committed to the “one China” principle that bears on China’s sovereignty and dignity, its security and territorial integrity. That is an issue of principle. Matters related to Xinjiang are China’s internal affairs. Foreign countries have no right to interfere.


	The Chinese Government attaches great importance to social and economic development in Xinjiang and it has taken a host of measures to promote stability, development, unity and people’s wellbeing. At the same time, within the confines of law, the government has taken steps to crack down on ethnic separatist activities and violent terrorist crimes to safeguard national security and life or property of the people. These measure have paid off. Right now, Xinjiang enjoys social stability. It’s economy is growing with a strong momentum, and ethnic groups are existing with each other in harmony. We hope that the United States could respect the fact and look at relevant matters in an objective light, and stop interfering in China’s internal affairs. In Tibet, there is ethnic minorities are having good relations, and their rights and interests are protected. A lot of foreign people have been to Tibet and Xinjiang. Facts are facts. Thank you.


STATE COUNCILOR WEI: Well, Taiwan is an inseparable part from China. This is a position repeated by Director Yang. To achieve reunification is a mission for our party and country. In the oath of allegiance to the U.S., there is this sentence saying this is a nation under the God, indivisible. So it is the same with Taiwan. It is an inalienable part of China. So if there – it’s – this territorial integrity is under threat, we will do it at any cost just like what the U.S. side had in Civil War.


MODERATOR: (Via interpreter) Now I will give the floor to Chinese journalists, one question at one time.


QUESTION: From Xinhua News Agency, I have a question for Minister Wei. Could you brief us on China’s defense policy and mil-to-mil relationship between China and the U.S.?


STATE COUNCILOR WEI: Well, President Xi and President Trump attach great importance to mil-to-mil relationship. So in every meeting they had, they always talk about this issue. So under the guidance of the two presidents, mil-to-mil relationship is moving forward and maintained stable growth on the whole, despite some problems. To make this mil-to-mil relationship a source of stability to the overall relationship is a consensus between our two sides. Now, we have kept the channel for strategic communication open. We have established dialogue and consultation mechanisms at various levels in counterterrorism, in peacekeeping, in humanitarian assistance. We have carried out many practical cooperation. By the end of this year, we will have maritime security consultation and also a joint military exercise on maritime humanitarian rescue and search.


	This year, we had three meetings with Secretary Mattis. We have exchanged visits in Singapore. We also had in-depth discussion. This kind of meeting and consultation have been conducted in constructive, candid manner. In enhancing mil-to-mil relationship and building strategic trust and promoting practical cooperation, we had many candid discussion and reached important common understandings.


	So in short, we believe that a stable mil-to-mil relationship is very important for a stable overall bilateral relationship. It serves the interests of both countries. Now, at the crossroads of our bilateral relationship, it is important for us to follow up on the consensus between our presidents. We need to prevent frictions from other regions to spread into the military sector to keep this mil-to-mil relationship a source of stability.


	China is committed to peaceful development. It follows a defense policy that is defensive in nature. It is enshrined in our constitution and the charter of the Communist Party of China. It is a solemn pledge we made. I’m not just repeating official line. We will never seek hegemony or aggression or expansion or arms race. The – development of China’s defense capability represents a growing force for world peace and the development of China’s defense capability is transparent. It is only for the protection of China itself to protect Chinese people from war, to give them a life of peace.


	And this capability-building is also transparent. It is conducted in commensurate with the need to safeguard China’s sovereignty, stability, and defense interests. China’s military spending also transparent. I have consulted my colleagues at the ministry of finance. Our military spending is made public to the world. We always report that to the United Nations. I think this can be made clear to all of you. China has been part of that UN report on military expenditure. Thank you.


MR PALLADINO: The next question, please. Wall Street Journal, Courtney McBride.


QUESTION: Thank you. The Trump administration has cited China as one reason for its planned withdrawal from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty. And I wondered, Secretary Pompeo and Secretary Mattis, whether you have raised the possibility of China participating instead in arms control and what the response was, if so. And alternatively, should the U.S. withdraw, this could open the door for U.S. deployment of missiles in Asia, and I’m curious from the director and the minister what the Chinese response to that possibility would be.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Thank you. We did not spend time talking in detail about that issue today.


MODERATOR: (Via interpreter) With CCTV.


QUESTION: (Via interpreter) Thank you. Director Yang, can you elaborate on China’s efforts for world peace and development, and in your view, how the current China-U.S. economic and trade issues should be addressed? And can you comment on the prospect of China-U.S. relations? Thank you.


POLITBURO MEMBER YANG: (Via interpreter) For the past four decades of reform and opening up, China has taken 700 million people out of poverty, and the whole nation of nearly 1.4 billion people are enjoying much better lives. The post-global financial crisis years have seen China accounting for over 30 percent of global economic growth annually. Today China is the third-largest contributor to the UN regular budget and the second-largest to its peacekeeping budget. China provides more peacekeepers than any other permanent member of the UN Security Council. China is fully committed to the norms of international relations that are centered on the purposes and principles of the UN Charter, and China is more than ready to develop friendship and cooperation with all countries of the world.


	Our trade and economic relations are mutually beneficial by nature and have delivered tangible gains to both countries and peoples. As part and parcel of the global industrial chain, China-U.S. trade and economic relations help allocate resources globally in a more efficient way, hence it is critical to the world economy. According to the U.S.-China Business Council, trade and economic relations with China help every American family save $850 annually and creates as many as 6 million jobs in this country, while the issues that exist in our economic and trade relations are the result of our different economic structures, development stages, and these issues can be resolved through dialogue and consultation. A trade war, instead of leading to any solution, will only end up hurting both sides and the global economy.


	The Chinese side has kept the channel of dialogue open. The door to negotiation remains open, and let’s not forget how our two sides have successfully navigated through previous rough patches in our economic and trade relations. I hope that our economic teams will follow through on what the president agreed upon in their November the 1st phone call, carry out equal-footed and good faith dialogue and communication, and before long find a mutually acceptable solution.


	We are going to celebrate the 40th anniversary of our diplomatic relations. For many years in the past, I have been to many states in this country, and I have made many American friends. In my conversation and encounters with them, I could feel their genuine friendship and goodwill toward China. Likewise, the Chinese people have this deep friendship toward the American people. I for one believe that our friendship has sunken deep roots in the hearts of our two peoples and will grow into a big tree with thick foliage. The further development of China-U.S. relations will for sure give our two peoples a greater sense of gain and satisfaction.


	As we mark the 40th anniversary next year, we need to prove with greater progress that the great statesmen from both countries made the right decision to open the door of exchange with each other and to establish diplomatic relations, and that decision is the right one and that has delivered real, tangible benefits to our two peoples. And I hope that in the next 40 years and longer, with our concerted efforts on the basis of coordination and cooperation, China-U.S. relations will score greater progress and achievements to bring greater benefits to our two peoples and people across the world.


	Thank you.


MR PALLADINO: And with that, our press conference concludes. Thank you to all of our principals, thank you to all of you. (In Mandarin.)

"November 7, 2018","
QUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Secretary, for sitting down with BBC Persian.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Hadi, it’s great to be with you today.


QUESTION: You say that you have put maximum pressure on Iran, most severe sanctions, but do you see any sign that the Iranian leaders are coming to the table to have negotiations?


SECRETARY POMPEO: We haven’t seen any indication of that yet, but we’re very hopeful that they will do that. We think it’s what the Iranian people would want them to do. Remember the purpose. The purpose is to stop Iran’s destabilizing influence in the region, assassination campaigns in Europe, work to support Lebanese Hizballah that’s threatened Americans and Israelis, and using Iranian people’s wealth to foment this terror around the world is not what the Iranian people want. And so our effort – not just the sanctions, but the American effort – is aimed at getting the Iranian leadership to understand this isn’t in the best interests of their country or their people and to change their behavior.


QUESTION: And what if they don’t come to the table? What’s your next move? What could be your next move?


SECRETARY POMPEO: We don’t talk about what next moves are, right? We’re hopeful that they will conclude it’s in their best interest to change this behavior. It’s not even just about coming to the table, right? It’s not about negotiations. It’s about a change in behavior. They’re arming people in Yemen, the Houthis, who are launching missiles into Riyadh and into other parts of the Middle East that threaten Americans, threaten, frankly, other Iranians who are traveling through these airports too. This is deeply destabilizing. It’s not what the Iranian people want.


	And so our efforts – our efforts aren’t aimed to punish the Iranian people and, indeed, exactly the opposite. Our aim here is to get the regime to decide it is not in its own country’s best interest to engage in this behavior and to change their ways.


QUESTION: You say you are not punishing the people. You say that the sanctions are not targeting the people. But what if --


SECRETARY POMPEO: No, they’re not.


QUESTION: But what if the sanctions hurt the Iranian people, the ordinary lives of them?


SECRETARY POMPEO: The folks who are hurting the Iranian people are the ayatollah and Qasem Soleimani and the Iranian leadership. That’s who is bringing the difficulties to Iran today. And you see this. You see this when you read of the protests. You see this when Iranian people have a chance to speak, although we know the human rights there don’t permit the Iranian people to speak freely. It’s the regime that is inflicting harm on the Iranian people, not the world and not the United States.


QUESTION: But as you – but you say that this is not a democratic regime. You say that the regime doesn’t care for Iranian people. But you say you do care for Iranian people.


SECRETARY POMPEO: We do.


QUESTION: So if the sanctions – if you see the facts that these sanctions are actually hurting Iranian people, if you see the facts that there are hardship in importing medicine for Iranian people, would that make any difference to you?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Hadi, I’m glad you mentioned medicine. None of the sanctions that have been imposed prevent humanitarian assistance and, indeed, there are big exemptions for medicine for sure, pharmaceuticals, but also more broadly than that for agricultural imports too so that the Iranian people have foodstuffs as well. We have provided, we have accommodated the Iranian people with our sanctions, and it’s now the Iranian Government’s responsibility to make sure that they do the right thing with the wealth, the enormous wealth, the incredible place and the incredible people in Iran. It’s their job to do the right thing for their people.


QUESTION: You said that there are waivers for – there are exemptions for medicine and for agricultural imports, but the issue is with the banking transfers. BBC sees the facts – we investigated about this – that these sanctions that are already in place are affecting that part of imports for medicine and agricultural and also food. And do you mind – I mean, do you mind mentioning more details about your efforts to make sure that medicine and food could be exempted from all the sanctions?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Of course. Not only are the transactions themselves exempted – that is, the transactions in medicine, for example – but the financial transactions connected to that activity also are authorized. There’s nothing that prevents this from happening in the sanctions that have been reimposed, and so we are confident that this process will work properly.


QUESTION: But then practically, when the process goes ahead, and if you see facts --


SECRETARY POMPEO: Yeah, we’re going to work to do two things: that things that are sanctioned don’t happen, and things that are permitted to happen are permissible, and can in fact happen.


	Well, remember, just so you remember, the leadership has to make a decision that they want their people to eat. They have to make a decision that they want to use their wealth to import medicine, and not use their wealth to fund Qasem Soleimani’s travels around the Middle East with – causing death and destruction. That’s the Iranian Government’s choice on how to use Iranian wealth. If they choose to squander, if the Iranian leadership chooses to spoil it, if they choose to use it in a way that doesn’t benefit the Iranian people, I’m very confident the Iranian people will take a response that tries to fix that themselves as well.


QUESTION: This also happened under previous administration, Obama administration, under those sanctions, that medicine and food were – I mean, there were difficulties in putting them – I mean --


SECRETARY POMPEO: I hope that doesn’t happen here. It’s not our intention.


QUESTION: And your critics say that Iran has outmaneuvered U.S. by staying in the deal while only – your only major allies that are supporting your policy are Israel and Saudi Arabia. On the other side, your European allies, China, Russia, even India – they want to keep business with Iran. Javad Zarif, your Iranian counterpart, just released a video yesterday saying that the U.S. is isolated here. Do you feel isolated here?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Yeah, I’ll tell you who’s isolated. It’s the man who just went out and said he wasn’t isolated: Mr. Zarif. We have an enormous coalition supporting our effort. The crude oil exports from nearly every country in the world have stopped already, even before the sanctions were re-imposed.


	There are European countries that support us, there are countries throughout the Middle East that support us, there are countries all around the world who understand that Iran’s malign activity is inappropriate. Even the E3, although they have tried to stay within the JCPOA, they understand too that Iran’s malign activity – there was an assassination attempt by Iran in Denmark, in the heart of Europe – they understand this risk, and they too are beginning to push back against the Iranian leadership and say enough is enough, behave like a normal nation, and when you do, we’ll welcome you back into the community of nations.


QUESTION: And Democrats were so much anger – angry about Saudi Arabia’s behavior in Yemen, also about Khashoggi’s death. Now that they hold the House, do you think they could make some obstacles for your foreign policy regarding the regional policy – for example, stopping arms sales, maybe, to Saudi Arabia? And how does that affect your regional policy about Iran?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Yeah, so two thoughts. First, the challenge in Yemen is in large part the responsibility of the Iranian leadership. It’s the Iranian leadership that continues to fuel the Houthis in a way that has engendered this civil war that has wreaked so much death and destruction inside of Yemen, so much – you see the pictures, they are heartbreaking. The Saudis have provided millions and millions of dollars of humanitarian relief. Hadi, do you know how much money Iran has provided for humanitarian relief in Yemen?


QUESTION: You tell me, please.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Yeah, almost nothing. Almost nothing.


QUESTION: But how --


SECRETARY POMPEO: This is a fundamental difference in --


QUESTION: Civilian casualties are --


SECRETARY POMPEO: This is a fundamental difference in the humanitarian nature of these two nations. Iran causes death and destruction inside of Yemen and does nothing to prevent the starvation, and the Saudis provide millions and millions of dollars – as do the Emiratis – to mitigate this risk and this harm. And so it’s a complicated problem; I made a statement last week. I’m very hopeful that every side will lay down their weapons in Yemen, and that Martin Griffiths, the UN special representative tasked with finding a political solution in Yemen – but that can’t happen unless the Iranians decide that the Houthis will no longer engage in violence there. If they do, we can find a peaceful path forward in Yemen, and I am very hopeful that that will happen. It’s the right outcome for everyone.


QUESTION: Thank you very much, Mr. Secretary.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Great. Hadi, thank you very much, sir.

	On behalf of the Department of State, I would like to wish all those celebrating Diwali a joyous and prosperous holiday.


	Also known as the “Festival of Lights,” this special occasion celebrates the triumph of light over darkness. Nearly a billion celebrants from around the world will light the diya, or lamp, as a reminder that good ultimately overcomes evil, understanding over ignorance, and kindness over animosity. Diwali is also a time of reflection and prayer when observers perform seva, or selfless service, without any expectation of reward or payment.


	As those celebrating decorate their homes with vibrant lights, I would also like to recognize the achievements of our friends in the United States observing Diwali who make important contributions to our country on a daily basis.


	Again, to those celebrating this joyous time I wish you a happy Diwali.

MODERATOR: Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Foreign Press Center. We are pleased to have with us this morning Secretary Pompeo and Secretary Mnuchin. They’ll both have some opening remarks and then hopefully we’ll have time for one or two questions afterwards.


	Secretary Pompeo, please.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Hey, Robert. Thank you. Good morning, everyone. It’s great to be here at the Foreign Press Center. It’s great to see you all. In May of this year, after President Trump withdrew from the nuclear deal, the Trump administration announced a new strategy to fundamentally alter the behavior of the Islamic Republic of Iran’s leadership. At the center of this effort – and there are multiple lines of effort – but at the center of it is an unprecedented campaign of economic pressure. Our objective is to starve the Iranian regime of the revenue it uses to fund violent and destabilizing activities throughout the Middle East, and indeed around the world.


	Our ultimate goal is to convince the regime to abandon its current revolutionary course. Just look at what happened last week. Denmark announced it had uncovered an Iranian regime assassination plot on its own soil. The Iranian regime has a choice. It can either do a 180-degree turn from its outlaw course of action and act like a normal country, or it can see its economy crumble.


	We hope a new agreement with Iran is possible, but until Iran makes changes in the 12 ways that I listed in May, we will be relentless in exerting pressure on the regime. As a reflection of that resolve, today we’re reimposing all sanctions that were previously lifted under the nuclear deal. This includes sanctions on energy, banking, shipping, and shipbuilding industries.


	Since the Trump administration came into office, we’ve done 19 rounds of sanctions targeting 168 Iranian entities. Today’s sanctions will accelerate the rapid decline of international economic activity in Iran since the implementation of our strategy in May. Since that time, since back in May, over 100 companies have withdrawn from Iran or canceled plans to do business there. It should be noted that if a company evades our sanctions regime and secretly continues sanctionable commerce in the Islamic Republic, the United States will levy severe, swift penalties on it, including potential sanctions. I promise you that doing business with Iran in defiance of our sanctions will ultimately be a much more painful business decision than pulling out of Iran and it – being connected to Iran entirely.


	More than 20 importing nations have zeroed out their imports of crude oil already, taking more than one million barrels of crude per day off the market. The regime today, since May, has lost over $2.5 billion in oil revenue. We have decided to issue temporary allotments to a handful of countries responsible to specific circumstances and to ensure a well-supplied oil market. The U.S. will be granting these exemptions to China, India, Italy, Greece, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, and Turkey. Each of those countries has already demonstrated significant reductions of the purchase of Iranian crude over the past six months, and indeed two of those eight have already completely ended imports of Iranian crude and will not resume as long as the sanctions regime remains in place. We continue negotiations to get all of the nations to zero.


	Additionally today, 100 percent of the revenue Iran receives from the sale of oil will be held in foreign accounts. Iran can only use this money for humanitarian trade or bilateral – in bilateral nonsanctioned goods.


	Speaking of Iran’s nuclear program, we have decided to grant narrow and temporary waivers that permit the continuation of three nonproliferation projects currently underway. Allowing these activities to continue for the time being will improve ongoing oversight of Iran’s civil nuclear program and make these facilities less susceptible to illicit and illegal nuclear uses. Rest assured Iran will never come close to getting a nuclear weapon on President Trump’s watch.


	I will now turn it over to Secretary Mnuchin.


SECRETARY MNUCHIN: Thank you. Today the United States is executing on the final actions to withdraw on the Obama administration’s fatally flawed Iran deal. This morning, we will fully impose sanctions on the Iranian regime. This is part of a maximum unprecedented economic pressure campaign the United States is waging against the world’s largest state sponsor of terror. Today we sanctioned more than 700 individuals, entities, aircraft, and vessels as part of Treasury’s largest ever single day action targeting Iran. Over 300 of those sanctions are new targets. In addition, we are relisting hundreds of individuals and entities that were previously sanctioned, granted sanctions relief under the JCPOA.


	These powerful sanctions directly target Iran’s banking, energy, and shipping sectors. The Iranian regime has funneled billions of dollars for the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps force through the banking sector. Today’s designation includes 50 Iranian banks and their foreign and domestic subsidiaries in conduction with Iran’s regime support for international terrorism, proliferation of mass destruction, or their means of delivery and human rights abuses.


	Our actions include the identification of more than 400 targets, including over 200 persons and vessels in Iran’s shipping and energy sector; Iran Air, the national airline of Iran, and more than 65 aircraft; the placement of nearly 250 persons in associated block properties on the Specially Designated Nationals list; the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran.


	Over the last five months, Treasury has implemented some of the most impactful sanctions ever seen. Combined with the previous actions, more than 900 Iran-related targets have been sanctioned under this administration in less than two years, marking the highest-ever level of U.S. economic pressure on Iran. We are making it abundantly clear to the Iranian regime that they will face mounting financial isolation until they fundamentally change their destabilizing behavior.


	Iran’s leaders must cease support for terrorism and end destructive regional activities immediately. They must stop ballistic missiles and abandon their nuclear ambitions if they seek a path to sanctions relief. We are watching the Iranian regime with laser focus. If they try to evade our sanctions, we will take action to disrupt their activity time and time again.


	The maximum pressure exerted by the United States is only going to mount from here. Companies around the world need to know we will be strictly enforcing our sanctions. Thank you.


MODERATOR: That – we’ll have time for a few questions. Let’s go to Sky News, Cordelia Lynch.


QUESTION: Hello, this is a question for Secretary Pompeo. The President invoked Game of Thrones when he was discussing sanctions. Do you think that was appropriate?


SECRETARY POMPEO: This administration has been consistent from, frankly, President Trump’s campaign to the first day he was inaugurated about our intention. We understand that the Islamic Republic of Iran presents a threat to the United States of America, and we are determined to stop it. And much has been made about this Game of Thrones. Qasem Soleimani responded, and I haven’t seen any of you comment on that. This is a man who has American blood on his hands. He’s killed American soldiers, and that’s not funny. And the actions that the Islamic Republic of Iran are taking are not about little silly things that people get wrapped up here in Washington, D.C., but about very serious matters that impact all of Europe, all the Middle East and the world, and our young men and women who are in harm’s way today.


MODERATOR: Thank you, sir. Next question is going to be Asahi Shimbun, Yuko Lanham. Yuko?


	All right. We’re going to move on to EFE, Beatriz Pascual Macias.


QUESTION: Hi, thank you very much. Thank you very much. I was wondering, what could you say to the European countries that were expecting to be in this list of countries that are not going to suffer the sanctions? And what kind of relation have you have with them, what are the conversations regarding this topic? Thank you.


SECRETARY POMPEO: You want to talk about on the financial side, Steven?


SECRETARY MNUCHIN: Well, I don’t think we’ve ever said that it relates to the European countries, that they’ll be exempt. I think quite the contrary. We’ve said that we expect them to honor the sanctions. Having said that, there are certain transactions that they can continue to do, whether they’re humanitarian transactions or specific trade in the restricted accounts. And again, let me just emphasize, as I said last week, we will make sure that humanitarian transactions are really going for those purposes. So this is not about hurting the people of Iran, but we will not let money be diverted to humanitarian purposes and then put for terrorist activities.


SECRETARY POMPEO: And then just to follow up, with respect to the relationship, we’ve been very candid and clear with all of the European countries. There are more than three, we should note. Many of them are fully supportive of what it is that we are undertaking. They have taken a different approach with respect to the JCPOA, but it is also something that the whole world should know. European businesses have already made their decisions. They’ve decided not to do business with the Islamic Republic of Iran, and so we’re very confident that the sanctions regime that we’re putting in place will be effective.


MODERATOR: Al Jazeera English, James Bays.


QUESTION: James Bays from Al Jazeera English. You talk about the destabilizing behavior of Iran in the region. How does that differ from the behavior of Saudi Arabia?


SECRETARY POMPEO: So let me just go through the list: Underwriting Lebanese Hizballah, that presents a threat to the United States of America and Israel; underwriting the Houthis in Yemen, causing an enormous conflict to take place there in that country; the efforts in Iraq to undermine the Iraqi Government, funding Shia militias that are not in the best interests of the Iraqi people; their efforts in Syria; the list goes on. The difference in behavior between those two countries is remarkable. Since we’ve taken office, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has been very supportive of our efforts on counterterrorism. They’ve assisted us. I know Secretary Mnuchin has worked with them on a couple of projects as well. It is completely clear the Islamic Republican of Iran is the destabilizing force in the Middle East today.


	Do you want to add to that?


SECRETARY MNUCHIN: No, I think it’s well said.


MODERATOR: Last question. Let’s go to TASS, Dmitry Kirsanov.


QUESTION: Thank you. Gentlemen, thanks a lot for coming over to brief us. For Secretary Pompeo. Sir, you mentioned that three waivers have been issued for the civilian nuclear energy project. Could you clarify what those are? And Bushehr nuclear power plant, will it be the one under the waiver? Thank you.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Thank you. That’s a great question. It’s a pretty complicated area, that nonproliferation issue. There are three. Bushehr is one of the three. But if I may, we will get out a full fact sheet on that here in the next hour or so that you’ll all be able to see. What we’ve authorized is very narrow, very limited, very time limited as well, but important nonetheless that these nonproliferation projects are not things that are taking place without some ability to see what’s going on, and we’ll give you the full details of the scope of those waivers.


MODERATOR: We have time for – this is the last one. Let’s go right to the front, right here, please.


QUESTION: Thank you. Roj Zalla with RUDAW TV in Iraqi Kurdistan. Mr. Secretary, Iran has very powerful hands in Iraq. Are you not concerned that with these sanctions Iran might increase the pressure on some of your allies in Iraq? And in that case, what can you do to reassure those allies?


SECRETARY POMPEO: So it’s a very reasonable question. Here’s the facts. Since the United States entered the JCPOA in 2015, Iran has turned up the heat on those very entities to which you’re referring. So we have a history, we have data set, we have a historical basis upon which to say that we know that the JCPOA didn’t impede Iran one bit from putting pressure on Kurdistan, pressure in Baghdad, pressure throughout the region. We are very hopeful that the set of efforts we’re undertaking – we’ve focused here on the financial and economic, but the full range of efforts we’re taking to push back against the Islamic Republic of Iran will have the intended effect of reducing Iran’s capacity to be destabilizing and present risk to the Middle East, to Europe, and the world.


MODERATOR: With that, that concludes this morning’s briefing. Thank you very much to Secretaries Pompeo and Mnuchin.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Thank you all


MODERATOR: Thank you, sir. Thank you all

"November 4, 2018","
QUESTION: Joining me now live from the State Department, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. Mr. Secretary, welcome back to Fox News Sunday.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Good morning, Chris. Great to be with you today.


QUESTION: You’re reimposing, as we said, all U.S. sanctions on Iran, but you’re giving exemptions to eight countries to allow them to keep buying oil from Tehran. Question: Why?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Well, Chris, the sanctions that will be reimposed tomorrow are the toughest sanctions ever put in place on the Islamic Republic of Iran. They’re aimed at a singular purpose: denying the world’s largest state sponsor of terror the capacity to do things like they did this past couple weeks, attempt an assassination campaign in the heart of Europe. These sanctions have already had an enormous impact. We’ve already reduced Iranian crude oil exports by over a million barrels per day. That number will fall farther. There’s a handful of places where countries have – that have already made significant reductions in their crude oil exports need a little bit more time to get to zero, and we’re going to provide that to them.


QUESTION: Is it true that you’re giving exemptions to two of Iran’s biggest customers, namely India and China? And do you have a firm commitment that within six months they will stop all oil purchases? Because there are a lot of experts who believe that India and China are never going to stop buying oil from Iran.


QUESTION: There are a lot of experts, Chris, that said President Trump’s policy wouldn’t have any impact because it was just the United States and other countries weren’t participating. And in fact, we have built an enormous coalition to keep this world safe and to deny Iran money. I am very confident that the sanctions that will be reimposed this Monday – not only the crude oil sanctions but the financial sanctions that are being put in place by the Treasury Department and over 600 designations of individuals and companies in Iran – will have the intended effect to alter the Iranian regime’s behavior. That’s our expectation. It’s the reason for President Trump’s policy.


QUESTION: But specifically, sir, do you have a firm commitment from India and China that they will stop all oil purchases from Iran in six months?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Chris, watch what we do. Watch as we’ve already taken more crude oil off the market than any time in previous history. Watch the efforts that President Trump’s policies have achieved. And we’ve done all of this too, Chris, while making sure that American consumers don’t suffer. We’ve got Brent crude at about the same price it was back in May when the President announced the withdrawal from the JCPOA. That’s important for American consumers, and the march to zero continues.


QUESTION: You’re talking about how effective these reimposition of sanctions are. But as you well know, there are some people who are criticizing the sanctions you’re reimposing and saying they’re not tough enough. And let me put this up on the screen. Republican senators – Republican Senators Cruz, Cotton, and Rubio – plan to introduce legislation to cut off Iranian banks from the global financial network known as SWIFT. And a group called United Against Nuclear Iran tweeted this about your sanctions: “Whatever happened to maximum pressure? They caved. Big time.”


	Mr. Secretary, your response?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Chris, the President’s policy of maximum pressure will be fully in place come tomorrow. Watch the Iranians. That’s who really understands the importance and the impact of the efforts that we’re undertaking. The rial has fallen to 140,000 rial to the dollar, has had an enormous impact already, and we are working diligently to make sure we support the Iranian people and that we direct our activity towards ensuring that the Islamic Republic of Iran’s malign behavior is changed. That’s the goal, that’s the mission, and that’s what we will achieve on behalf of the President.


QUESTION: But how do you respond, for instance, to the senators who are saying look, we should have cut them off from SWIFT, which is this big --


SECRETARY POMPEO: Chris --


QUESTION: -- financial --


SECRETARY POMPEO: Chris, Chris --


QUESTION: -- clearinghouse?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Chris, the Iranian banks that engage in sanctionable behavior will be sanctioned by the Department of Treasury, period, full stop.


QUESTION: And I understand what you’re saying. On the other hand --


SECRETARY POMPEO: Well, good. That’s great, Chris.


QUESTION: If I may, sir, you’ve got Senators Cotton, Senator Cruz, Senator Rubio – they’re pretty knowledgeable on the subject. They’re not persuaded.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Chris, I worked with Senator Cotton. We were the two individuals that discovered the side deals now almost three years ago to the JCPOA, these secret side deals. I’ve been at this a long time. No one’s going to argue that Secretary Pompeo isn’t tough on Iran, and no one is going to argue that President Trump isn’t doing the same.


QUESTION: Meanwhile, let’s turn to another one of your hotspots you’re dealing with. North Korea is now threatening to resume its nuclear buildup because they say that the U.S. has not matched them in offering concessions, in this case lifting economic sanctions. They say that they’ve made concession and the Trump administration has not followed suit.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Chris, I’ll be meeting this week in New York City with my counterpart Kim Yong-chol. We’ll have a good opportunity to continue the denuclearization discussions that were set out just a few months back. It seems like a long time ago in news world, but it was just this past June when President Trump and Chairman Kim met and set us on the path that we’re on today. We haven’t had any missile tests. There have been no nuclear tests. We’ve had the returns of American remains. These are all good steps. We’re continuing to negotiate with the North Koreans to achieve what President Trump set out: the full denuclearization verified by the United States of the Korean Peninsula, and then a brighter future for the North Korean people.


QUESTION: But to follow up specifically, what’s your reaction to the foreign ministry of North Korea saying – threatening that they are going to resume nuclear activity? What’s, one, your reaction to that? And two, is there any possibility that to get them to stop that that the U.S. will change its policy and start offering concessions on a kind of tit-for-tat basis, a phased effort by both countries?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Chris, I’m not worried about rhetoric. We’ve seen this as we go through negotiations. Stray voltage happens to be all around us, and we’re very focused. We know with whom we’re negotiating. We know what their positions are. And President Trump has made his position very clear: no economic relief until we have achieved our ultimate objective.


QUESTION: Let’s turn to Saudi Arabia. You met with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman about three weeks ago about the death of Jamal Khashoggi, and here’s what you said after your meeting with the crown prince: “They told me they were going to conduct a thorough, complete, transparent investigation. They made a commitment, too, to hold anyone connected to any wrongdoing that may be found accountable for that, whether they are a senior officer or official.”


QUESTION: But since then, I don’t have to tell you, the Saudi story has kept changing. Do you now think that the Saudi crown prince lied both to you and to President Trump with what he told you back then? Based on all the evidence that you have gotten since, including the tapes that CIA Director Gina Haspel has heard, do you now believe that this was a premeditated hit by the Saudi royal family against Khashoggi?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Well, Chris, the Saudis have acknowledged that this was a premeditated attack. The facts that we’re finding still are unfolding. We’re still working diligently on that. We talk with folks from Turkey, from Saudi Arabia nearly every day to continue those efforts.


	We’ve begun to hold some officials accountable. We’ve revoked visas from 16 individuals that we have been able to identify so far that were, in fact, connected to that. We’ll continue to do that.


	And as I said that day when I returned, we will hold all of those responsible for the murder of Jamal Khashoggi accountable. And we will do that, Chris, at the same time while ensuring that the strategic relationship between the United States and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia – one that has a great impact on the issue we just spoke about, the capacity to deny the world’s largest state sponsor of terror the ability to threaten America and Israel – we will continue to work to maintain that important strategic relationship while holding accountable those responsible for this atrocious death.


QUESTION: Meanwhile, you and Defense Secretary Mattis this week called for negotiations and a ceasefire within 30 days between the U.S.-backed Saudi forces and the rebels that are fighting in a war inside Yemen. There are reports that up to 16,000 Yemeni civilians have been killed in this conflict and that around 14 million Yemenis are now on the brink if not already in famine conditions.


	Two questions. First of all, are you comfortable with the role that the U.S. has played in backing Saudi Arabia in this effort in Yemen? And secondly, if the humanitarian crisis is so urgent, why allow this to continue for another month, sir?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Chris, we did make a statement this week, Secretary Mattis and I. Frankly, it’s nothing new. We have been urging all the parties to come to the table and recognize that there’s no military victory that can be achieved in Yemen. We’ve asked the Iranians to do that too, Chris. Much of the harm that is taking place there comes from the fact the Iranians continue to supply weapons and missiles to the Houthi rebels that are fighting there in Saudi Arabia. They are responsible for the starvation in Yemen as well.


	We want all the parties, under Martin Griffiths of the UN, to come to the table, negotiate a solution that ends the very difficult, tragic situation that’s taking place in Yemen today.


QUESTION: Secretary Pompeo, thank you.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Thank you, Chris.


QUESTION: Thanks for your time. It’s always good to talk with you, sir.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Thank you, sir. Have a good day.

QUESTION: We want to go now to the State Department Diplomatic Room in Washington and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. Mr. Secretary, I want to start with the sanctions that will be reimposed this week on Iran. A number of European countries do business with Iran. The President had formally said anyone doing business with Iran will not be doing business with the United States. So can European allies expect they will not be doing business with the United States?


SECRETARY POMPEO: John, good morning. That’s right. The European companies will not be permitted to do business with both the United States and with Iran, frankly since May, since the President’s announcement of withdrawal from the ill-fated agreement. European companies have fled Iran in great numbers. Hundreds of businesses have departed Iran. The whole world understands that these sanctions are real, that they are important, that they drive the Iranian people’s opportunity to make the changes in Iran that they so desperately want and stop Iran from having the wealth and money that they need to continue to foment terror around the world.


QUESTION: But it’s the companies that won’t be doing business, not the countries themselves. In other words, they won’t be punished if any company doing business in Iran – the country won’t be punished.


SECRETARY POMPEO: That’s right. These sanctions apply to those who conduct sanctionable transactions. The Treasury has a set of sanctions, the State Department has its own set of sanctions, and those will all come back into place on Monday of this week, and they’ll be the toughest sanctions ever placed against the Islamic Republic of Iran.


QUESTION: The President put out a poster of himself and said, “Sanctions are coming.” What was that about?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Yeah, he was putting the world on notice that the terror regime which threatens Israel through Iranian funding of Lebanese Hizballah; that the terror regime that attempted to conduct an assassination in Denmark over the past few weeks; that the terror regime that continues to fund the Houthis launching missiles into Riyadh and into Dubai – that’s going to stop. That behavior must change, and sanctions from the United States will be reimposed at midnight tonight.


QUESTION: What if they restart their nuclear program in Iran?


SECRETARY POMPEO: We’re confident that the Iranians will not make that decision.


QUESTION: Let me ask you a question about North Korea. You have talks this week. North Korea is saying they might restart their nuclear program if the U.S. does not start lifting sanctions. Is it still the U.S. position that North Korea will not see any economic sanctions lift until there is complete denuclearization?


SECRETARY POMPEO: So, John, I will. I’ll be in New York City at the end of this week meeting with my counterpart, Kim Yong-chol. I expect we’ll make some real progress, including an effort to make sure that the summit between our two leaders can take place, where we can make substantial steps towards denuclearization.


	John, we have to remember and the American people need to remember the North Koreans haven’t launched a missile, haven’t conducted a nuclear test. They allowed the return of American remains. We’ve had success in just the handful of months since this past June, and we continue to make good progress. I’m confident that we’ll advance the ball again this week when I’m in New York City.


QUESTION: Mr. Secretary, you said that North Korea will not see any economic sanctions lifted until it has demonstrated complete denuclearization. Is that still your position?


SECRETARY POMPEO: It is. Not only complete denuclearization, but our capacity to verify that that has taken place --


QUESTION: Okay.


SECRETARY POMPEO: -- is also a prerequisite to lifting economic sanctions.


QUESTION: Let me ask you about the caravan at the U.S. southern border. General Colin Powell said, “I see no threat requiring [that] this kind of deployment.” He’s referring there to the deployment of troops from the Pentagon. Retired General Martin Dempsey said it was “a wasteful deployment of over-stretched Soldiers and Marines.” What’s your response?


SECRETARY POMPEO: This is a problem that’s gone on too long. President Trump is determined to ensure that we have sovereignty of America at our southern border and that we protect our American border.


	As the Secretary of State, I’ve been very involved in working with the governments in Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, and certainly the Government of Mexico, and I’ve also had the chance to speak with the incoming government that is now 26 days out from taking power in Mexico. We have made clear to them they need to undertake every effort that they can to stop this illegal migration from entering the United States, and the President has made very clear they will not be permitted to enter our country unlawfully.


QUESTION: The charge --


SECRETARY POMPEO: If they want to come here legally, if they want to come here lawfully, that’s the American tradition. It’s the American way. We continue to be the most generous nation in the world with respect to immigration. But illegal immigration will not be permitted.


QUESTION: The charge here, Mr. Secretary, is that the President is thinking about this in political terms and that’s why he’s done this deployment, all of this rhetoric this week. Do you think he thinks about it in political terms, this caravan and how it might benefit the Republicans?


SECRETARY POMPEO: I’ve been involved in scores of conversations about stopping illegal immigration from Mexico, and never once has there been a discussion of the political impact in U.S. domestic politics. It has always been --


QUESTION: Then, Mr. Secretary --


SECRETARY POMPEO: -- about securing the safety of the American people and securing our southern border.


QUESTION: So if that’s never happened, why then did the President – in a rally said, speaking about the caravan, “Did they energize our base or what?”


SECRETARY POMPEO: The President has been trying diligently to get our foolish immigration laws changed since he took office. He talked about this in his campaign. Many of the challenges we face today with illegal immigration are because we have a set of rules, a set of laws, that don’t allow us to fully secure that southern border. The President is working through the proper process, the Constitution and political process, to make those changes to the laws, and he is very hopeful, I think, that when Congress returns in January there will be a Congress prepared to support his efforts to secure our southern border.


QUESTION: But you would agree --


SECRETARY POMPEO: That’s completely appropriate.


QUESTION: You would agree that the President thinks this is a benefit for his base, which he says has been energized by this caravan and his response to it. So it seems like he does see it as a political benefit.


SECRETARY POMPEO: As the Secretary of State, I want to talk about American national security. We are determined to secure the southern border, John.


QUESTION: Okay. I’ll take that lack of a response as a yes. Final question, Mr. Secretary, is on Saudi Arabia. You are waiting for more investigation on the death of columnist Jamal Khashoggi. What more needs to be answered?


SECRETARY POMPEO: We still have lots of work to do to figure out the full range of persons that need to be held accountable. We’re working with the Turkish Government, with the Saudi Government, and with anyone else who has relevant facts for us to be able to determine all of those who were responsible for this atrocious murder of Jamal Khashoggi, which the Saudis themselves now acknowledge was premeditated. We need to get to the bottom of it. We need to find out who was responsible and hold them accountable, and do all of this, John, while protecting the enormously important strategic interests that the United States maintains with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. We began our conversation about Iran. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has been an important partner for the United States in attempting to change the behavior of the world’s largest state sponsor of terror from that Islamic republic.


QUESTION: Very briefly, is it still possible the crown prince could be involved in this?


SECRETARY POMPEO: We’re going to chase the facts wherever they go --


QUESTION: All right.


SECRETARY POMPEO: -- and we’re going to hold accountable each of those who we find responsible.


QUESTION: Mr. Secretary, we’re very grateful. Thanks so much for being with us.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Thank you, John. Have a good day.

"November 2, 2018","
MS NAUERT: Thank you, sir. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to today’s on-the-record call on the Iran snapback sanctions. We’re pleased to have with us Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Secretary of the Treasury Steve Mnuchin. They will each have brief remarks at the top and then take several of your questions. We’ll start first with Secretary Pompeo.


	Secretary, please, go ahead.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Thank you, Heather. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining the call. Earlier this year, President Trump withdrew from the fatally flawed nuclear deal and implemented a new campaign aimed at fundamentally altering the behavior of the Islamic Republic of Iran. This part of the campaign about which we’re speaking today is simple. It is aimed at depriving the regime of the revenues that it uses to spread death and destruction around the world. Our ultimate aim is to compel Iran to permanently abandon its well-documented outlaw activities and behave as a normal country.


	Today, Secretary Mnuchin and I will discuss one of the many lines of effort to achieve these fundamental changes in the Iranian regime’s behavior as directed by the President. While important, these economic sanctions are just a part of the U.S. Government’s total effort to change the behavior of the Ayatollah Khamenei, Qasem Soleimani, and the Iranian regime.


	On November 5th, the United States will reimpose sanctions that were lifted as part of the nuclear deal on Iran’s energy, ship building, shipping, and banking sectors. These sanctions hit at the core areas of Iran’s economy. They are necessary to spur changes we seek on the part of the regime.


	In order to maximize the effect of the President’s pressure campaign, we have worked closely with other countries to cut off Iranian oil exports as much as possible. We expect to issue some temporary allotments to eight jurisdictions, but only because they have demonstrated significant reductions in their crude oil and cooperation on many other fronts and have made important moves towards getting to zero crude oil importation. These negotiations are still ongoing. Two of the jurisdictions will completely end imports as part of their agreements. The other six will import at greatly reduced levels.


	Let me put this in context for you. The Obama administration issued SREs to 20 countries multiple times between 2012 and 2015. We will have issued, if our negotiations are completed, eight and have made it clear that they are temporary. Not only did we decide to grant many fewer exemptions, but we demanded much more serious concessions from these jurisdictions before agreeing to allow them to temporarily continue to import Iranian crude oil. These concessions are critical to ensure that we increase our maximum pressure campaign and accelerate towards zero.


	Our laser-focused approach is succeeding in keeping prices stable with a benchmark Brent price right about where it was in May of 2018 when we withdrew from the JCPOA. Not only is this good for American consumers and the world economy, it also ensures that Iran is not able to increase its revenue from oil as its exports plummet. We will, we expect, have reduced Iranian crude oil exports by more than 1 million barrels even before these sanctions go into effect.


	This massive reduction since May of last year is three to five times more than what many analysts were projecting when President Trump announced our withdrawal from the deal back in May. We exceeded our expectations for one simple reason: Maximum pressure means maximum pressure.


	The State Department closed the Obama era condensate loophole which allowed countries to continue importing condensate from Iran even while sanctions were in place. This loophole allowed millions of dollars to continue to flow to the regime.


	This administration is treating condensate the same as crude since the regime makes no distinction between the two when it decides to spend its oil revenue on unlawful ballistic missiles, terrorism, cyberattacks, and other destabilizing activities like the assassination plot Denmark disclosed this past week.


	And starting today, Iran will have zero oil revenue to spend on any of these things. Let me say that again. Zero. One hundred percent of the revenue that Iran receives from the sale of crude oil will be held in foreign accounts and can be used by Iran only for humanitarian trade or bilateral trade in nonsanctioned goods and services.


	These new sanctions will accelerate the highly successful effects of our sanctions that have already occurred. The maximum pressure we imposed has caused the rial to drop dramatically, Rouhani’s cabinet is in disarray, and the Iranian people are raising their voices even louder against a corrupt and hypocritical regime.


	On that note, our actions today are targeted at the regime, not the people of Iran, who have suffered grievously under this regime. It’s why we have and will maintain many humanitarian exemptions to our sanctions including food, agriculture commodities, medicine, and medical devices.


	I will now turn the call over to Secretary Mnuchin.


SECRETARY MNUCHIN: Thank you very much. Since the beginning of the Trump administration, the Treasury Department has been committed to putting a stop to Iran’s destabilizing activities across the world. We’ve engaged a massive economic pressure campaign against Iran, which remains the world’s largest state sponsor of terrorism. To date, we have issued 19 rounds of sanctions on Iran, designating 168 targets as part of our maximum pressure campaign. We have gone after the financial networks that the Iranian regime uses to fuel its terrorist proxies and Hizballah and Hamas, to fund the Houthis in Yemen, and to support the brutal Assad regime in Syria.


	The 180-day wind-down period ends at 11:59 p.m. Eastern Standard Time on Sunday November 4th. As of Monday November 5th, the final round of snapback sanctions will be enforced on Iran’s energy, shipping, shipbuilding, and financial sectors. As part of this action on Monday, the Treasury Department will add more than 700 names to our list of blocked entities. This includes hundreds of targets previously granted sanctions relief under the JCPOA, as well as more than 300 new designations. This is substantially more than we ever have previously done. Sanctions lifted under the terms of Iran’s nuclear deal will be reimposed on individuals, entities, vessels, and aircraft that touch numerous segments of Iran’s economy. This will include Iran’s energy sector and financial sectors. We are sending a very clear message with our maximum pressure campaign that the U.S. intends to aggressively enforce our sanctions. Any financial institution, company, or individual who evades our sanctions risks losing access to the U.S. financial system and the ability to do business with the United States or U.S. companies. We are intent on ensuring that global funds stop flowing to the coffers of the Iranian regime.


	I want to make a couple of comments on the SWIFT messaging systems since I’ve received lots of questions about this over the last few weeks. So I’d like to make four points. Number one, SWIFT is no different than any other entity. Number two, we have advised SWIFT the Treasury will aggressively use its authorities as necessary to continue intense economic pressure on the Iranian regime, and that SWIFT would be subject to U.S. sanctions if it provides financial messaging services to certain designated Iranian financial institutions. Number three, we have advised SWIFT that is must disconnect any Iranian financial institution that we designate as soon as technologically feasible to avoid sanctions exposure. Number four, just as was done before, humanitarian transactions to nondesignated entities will be allowed to use the SWIFT messaging system as they have done before, but banks must be very careful that these are not disguised transactions or they could be subject to certain sanctions. Thank you very much.


MS NAUERT: Thank you, sirs. Why don’t we go ahead, take our first question. We’ll go to Matt Lee with the Associated Press. Matt, go ahead.


QUESTION: Thank you, Heather. Both – either or both of you, on SWIFT, there are a lot of complaints among the President’s allies in Congress that this does not go far enough, and that without designating – without going after SWIFT harder for these messaging transactions, that it allows a serious loophole. I understand Secretary Mnuchin’s four points on it, but how will you address this criticism? Because it’s already coming even before this announcement today.


SECRETARY MNUCHIN: Okay, well let me – Secretary Mnuchin – let me make some comments. First of all, I think there’s been a lot of fueled misinformation as it relates to SWIFT and what we’re doing with SWIFT. So that’s why I want to be very clear. So one, okay, I think there was information that SWIFT would not be subject to sanctions. That’s not the case. SWIFT will be subject to sanctions. Number two, as I said, that – could be subject to sanctions, excuse me. Number two, it is our intent that they cut off designated entities as was done before. And again, I think there’s misinformation that they cut off everybody last time. Again, they did allow for certain entities to do humanitarian transactions consistent with what’s allowed under our sanctions. There are exceptions for humanitarian sanctions, but I want to very clear, people need to be careful that those are real humanitarian – those are real humanitarian transactions. So again, I would just say I – hopefully this will clarify the misinformation that’s out there.


MS NAUERT: Next question, we’ll go to Nick Wadhams from Bloomberg.


QUESTION: Hi. I had a question about the oil sanctions going into effect. Will those include – or will there be exceptions granted for nonhumanitarian transactions such as consumer goods, as were allowed last time, or will Iran only be allowed – or will Iran only be allowed to spend revenue that it gains through – on humanitarian items? And then second, if you’re giving eight waivers and two jurisdictions are already cutting imports to zero, what’s the point of giving them – those two jurisdictions waivers? Thanks.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Nick, this is Mike Pompeo. With respect to your first point, you’ll see the details on Monday. There are nonhumanitarian goods that we included in there, but they’re small. They’re ones that you would’ve already seen in the exemptions that were granted under the direction of the President. Second, some of these will take a few months to get to zero. So by November 5th they won’t be there. That’s the purpose of those exemptions, to give them a little bit longer to wind down. Weeks.


MS NAUERT: Pardon me?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Weeks longer to wind down.


MS NAUERT: Next question, Mike Warren from the Weekly Standard.


QUESTION: Hi, gentlemen, thank you. I want to follow-up on Matt’s questions about SWIFT. Secretary Mnuchin, you said that certain financial institutions in Iran will be cut off from SWIFT. Could you explain exactly which financial institutions, or maybe the financial institutions described in a Treasury FAQ, the Central Bank of Iran and other Iranian financial institutions described in section 104(c)(2) blah blah blah – could you be more specific about which institutions? And how can – how can the United States Government be confident in SWIFT’s ability to monitor transactions using SWIFT that they – I imagine there are numerous of these transactions going on daily. How can the United States Government be confident that those are not transactions that are funding the bad actions that the government says is – they are trying to stop?


SECRETARY MNUCHIN: So again, let me comment on the first issue, which – that the list of banks, which will be substantially longer than last time, will be coming out over the weekend. And as it relates to monitoring transactions, again, financial institutions have liability for any transactions that go through SWIFT or any other mechanisms. I’m being told the list will come out on Monday. And again, it’s our expectation that that will be implemented as soon as technologically feasible.


MS NAUERT: Okay, thank you. Next question goes to Elise Labott from CNN.


QUESTION: Thank you. The question is for both secretaries, but maybe from a different angle. Could you address the workaround that the Europeans are trying to institute to avoid U.S. banks, maybe using their own central banks or electronic transactions? For Secretary Mnuchin, how much revenue do you think this would give the Iranians, and how seriously are you taking that in terms of a financial component?


	And then Secretary Pompeo, could you talk about once these sanctions go into effect and if the Europeans do try to institute this workaround, what the diplomatic implications for relations with European allies? Thank you.


SECRETARY MNUCHIN: I’ll comment on the Special Purpose Vehicle. I have no expectation that there will be any transactions that are significant that go through a Special Purpose Vehicle based upon what I’ve seen. But when the details come out of some Special Purpose Vehicle, if there are sanctions – if there are transactions that go through there that have the intent of evading our sanctions, we will aggressively pursue our remedies.


SECRETARY POMPEO: And let me take the second part of that. We’ve been working closely with the Europeans on this set of issues. We’re very confident that our sanctions will be incredibly effective. And frankly, I can prove that already. As I stated, the Iranian economy today is already feeling the effects of this. It’s already feeling the effects of this effort not because the sanctions have snapped back – that won’t occur until – on Monday – but because the world and Iran knew this was coming. And so European entities of any scale that are doing business with the United States of America have already ceased their conduct with Iran. There may be an exception to that, but there has been an enormous departure of European businesses.


	So whatever it may be that the EU is proposing, the folks who have risk – financial risk, business risk, operation risk – have already made their decision about the effectiveness of the sanctions that will be reimposed this coming week.


MS NAUERT: Our next question goes to Michele Kelemen with NPR.


QUESTION: Yeah, hi, thank you. One quick question that – just technically, which of the eight countries are getting these waivers? And then secondly, for Secretary Pompeo, you said in one of your interviews this week that the U.S. wants to restore democracy in Iran. Is that one of the goals of this campaign? And if so, how do you make sure that these sanctions aren’t going to hurt average Iranians who, as you point out, are suffering under this corrupt regime?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Yes, thanks for the question. The President’s policy is very clear: We are looking to change the Iranian leadership’s behavior. I laid out the 12 things we’ve asked them to do; that is the goal not only of what we’re speaking about this morning – and please don’t lose sight, we’re talking about a set of sanctions that will be reimposed on Monday. The administration’s efforts to change Iranian behavior are far broader, far deeper, there are many other lines of effort. We’re simply focused on this line of effort today because of the significance of November 5th.


	My comments about restoring democracy are completely consistent with what we have described before. We’re counting on the Iranian people to have the opportunity and we are working towards allowing the Iranian people to have the opportunity to have the government they want, a government that doesn’t take wealth from their country and spend it on malign activity around the world. I mean, this is a regime that is conducting a assassination campaign inside of Europe today, murdering not Iranian citizens in those countries, but folks who live, reside, and are citizens of those European countries. These are the behaviors we’re trying to change, and our every effort is aimed at giving the Iranian people the opportunity to have the government that they not only want but deserve.


MS NAUERT: Next question: Josh Rogin, Washington Post.


QUESTION: Thank you so much for your time. Thanks for your service. I’d like to ask you about the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran. My understanding is that you waived secondary sanctions on foreign firms that do business with that organization, mostly Russian and Chinese firms that are involved in the Arak and Fordow facilities. Why did you make that decision, and why are you letting Arak and Fordow continue? And are there plans to change that in the future? Thank you.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Thanks, thanks for the question. We are not allowing the continued work to develop nuclear weapons and nuclear weapons systems in Arak and Fordow. We will provide on Monday a complete explanation of what we’re going to do with the continued efforts to prevent those facilities from doing the things that put the world at risk through proliferation, and we’ll give you all the detail. It’s a long and complex answer, but we’re happy to provide it to you on Monday morning.


MS NAUERT: Final question to Arshad with Reuters, please.


QUESTION: Two things. One, exactly how many financial institutions are going to be redesignated, i.e. put back on the SDN list on Monday? Previously I believe the number was close to or slightly above 30. You said it would be substantially more. How many is it going to be?


	Secondly, you pointedly said that you were granting the exceptions to eight jurisdictions. Is one of those jurisdictions the European Union, thereby covering a much larger group of countries, i.e. 28 EU member-states?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Steven, you want to go first?


SECRETARY MNUCHIN: I’ll answer the first part. So the bank list will come out on Monday. Again, it will be more than last time, and again, we may continue to add banks to that in the future. But the original list will come out on Monday and we’ll carefully monitor situations to add on more banks as needed.


SECRETARY POMPEO: The second part of your question, we will provide the list of the eight jurisdictions on Monday. The EU will not be receiving an SRE.


MS NAUERT: The final question, Carol Morello, Washington Post.


QUESTION: Hi, thanks for doing this. Say in the past, the Iranians have blended their oil with foreign oil to evade sanctions, and there have already been reports that they are turning off the ID tags on their tankers. So what in particular are you going to be doing to track their attempts to evade these sanctions?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Thanks for the question. Make no mistake about it, the Iranians will do everything they can to circumvent these sanctions – that’s unsurprising to me. They’ll turn off ships, they’ll try and do it through private vessels, they’ll try and find third parties that don’t interact with the United States to provide insurance mechanisms. The list of Iranian efforts to circumvent these sanctions is long. You should all recognize there’s a reason for that. These sanctions are far tougher than the sanctions that have ever been imposed on the Islamic Republic of Iran. That is why they are so desperate to find ways to circumvent it.


	And I won’t speak to our efforts to counter those circumvention efforts. There are many, they are varied, and make no mistake: The United States is fully prepared to do all that we can to prevent Iran from circumventing not only the crude oil sanctions and the financial sanctions, but all of the designations and all of the other sanctions that are being reimposed this coming Monday and those that are already in place.


SECRETARY MNUCHIN: And I would just add to that that anybody that does facilitate those transactions will be subject to sanctions and will be added to the list.


MS NAUERT: Secretary Pompeo, Secretary Mnuchin, thank you so much for joining us. Everyone, thanks for joining the call. Have a great day. We’ll be putting out a transcript shortly.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Thank you all.

QUESTION: All right, 25 till the top of the hour. Glad you’re with us. Four days until the important midterm elections. I’m just going to take a slight break in our programming because that’s all we’ve been talking about today, but starting Monday, the President now reimposing all the sanctions that were lifted under what was the acceptable – unacceptable Iranian deal. And the President is putting in place what are the single toughest sanctions ever on the Iranian regime, targeting much of the corrupt regime’s critical sectors, including the economy, energy, shipping, shipbuilding, financial sectors. The impact already being felt in a lot of ways.


	Here to update us on the importance of this is, I think, the Secretary of State – the best we’ve had in our lifetime – Mike Pompeo is with us, also former CIA director. How are you, sir?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Sean, I’m good. Thanks for the kind words.


QUESTION: Well, you’ve been doing really well. I had a chance to see you in Singapore and Helsinki, and you’ve been traveling the world pretty much day and night, and a lot of good things on foreign policy happening. Let’s start with these sanctions.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Yes, sir. So come Monday, as you said, we will not only be reimposing the sanctions that were in place before the crazy JCPOA was entered into, but there’ll be over several hundred designations. We will ultimately move Iran to zero crude oil. That’ll take us some number of months to do that. We’ve been able to do that in a way that hasn’t had a huge impact on crude oil prices. That’s a good thing for American consumers.


	But remember the purpose. The Islamic Republic of Iran is the world’s largest state sponsor of terror. We’re trying to change the ayatollah and Qasem Soleimani’s behavior to keep the American people safe and secure. That’s the mission, these sanctions are a part of our effort, and they’re already being felt by the Iranian leadership.


QUESTION: We’ve known for a long time they’re the number-one state sponsor of terror, but they also have been fighting many proxy wars in the region, including their responsibility and culpability of killing Americans in Iraq and Afghanistan.


	But with that said, there is – and putting aside what happened to this individual Khashoggi, there seems to be an opportunity and a new alliance that has risen against the potential of a nuclear-armed Iran and Iranian hegemony in the region, and that is the United States, Israel, the Jordanians, the Egyptians, the Saudis, the Emirates all standing together in ways that nobody even imagined just a few years ago creating an alliance against Iran. What is the status of that?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Sean, that is all the good work of President Trump. He made this fundamental decision early on in the administration that this was the greatest threat to the United States and so did, in fact, build out an enormous coalition. There are some European countries in that too. We need to get more of them. But you’re right, whether it’s the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia or the Emirates or Egypt, these are all countries that understand their threat to regional stability in the Middle East. And we, of course, know the risk that it presents to us.


	Sean, you would have probably seen this week there was another assassination attempt in Europe by Iran trying to kill Europeans. This is outrageous and it’s the kind of behavior that the sanctions that go back next week are aimed at correcting.


QUESTION: Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is with us. One of the things that I think is going to be one of the President’s biggest legacies is his advancement towards full and complete energy independence for the United States. And by that, we have the North Dakota Keystone pipelines; the President lifting the bureaucratic assault on the coal industry has helped West Virginia and Kentucky – we see immediate results there – opening up ANWR and drilling in the 48 states and off our coast. We have more oil, more natural gas, more coal than the Middle East combined, which means not only will we be able to produce all of our energy needs, which is the lifeblood of any economy, but then we can also help out our Western allies like Germany recently. And instead of making Russia and Putin rich again and the threat of him turning off the spigot one day, we could help out our Western European allies.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Sean, this is often overlooked in the national security realm, but the importance of the American energy renaissance that President Trump has greenlighted, has permitted to happen, can’t be underestimated. Our ability to produce nine, ten, eleven million barrels of oil today, enormous natural gas resources, gives us freedom from others who might want to use their energy to extort America into engaging in behavior they preferred. It gives us the capacity not to have to accept a bad deal because we needed some energy. And then in fact, you’re right, it gives us the capacity to influence what’s going on elsewhere in the world by delivering good American energy that creates jobs at home as well.


QUESTION: I know you’ve followed up since Singapore as it relates to North Korea. Let me ask you – I couldn’t understand the media’s coverage of it because the President really gave up nothing except for a few kind words, but we did get the remains sent back from the Korean War, we did have hostages returned as well. We don’t see rockets being fired over Japan or the world being threatened. It looks like little rocket man fire and fury, our button’s bigger than yours and works, all of a sudden now we’re talking about the denuclearization of the entire Korean Peninsula. What is the status of those talks? I know you’ve had numerous since Singapore.


SECRETARY POMPEO: I have. In fact, I’ll have another set of conversations next week with my counterpart, the number two person. I was with Chairman Kim early in October. In each of those conversations he has made clear his intention to denuclearize.


	Sean, you know as well as I do we’ve got to verify that. We’ve got to make sure that we get that piece of it right. We won’t accept anyone’s word for it. But that work, which will take time, has delivered for America good outcomes already, outcomes that weren’t delivered by previous administrations and ones that have benefited America enormously, right. No nuclear testing, no missile testing. Those are not small things. They’re good steps along the way. A lot of work remains, but I’m confident that we will keep the economic pressure in place until such time as Chairman Kim fulfills the commitment he made to President Trump back in June in Singapore.


QUESTION: He’s even talking about having a denuclearized North Korea within a year. Do you think that’s possible still?


SECRETARY POMPEO: I think it’s physically possible. I think it will be a real challenge to move to that timeline. And President Trump’s been pretty clear, we’re not going to be driven into – to artificial timelines that are set by others. We’re going to continue to make progress. And so long as we have the capacity to understand what’s going on there and to continue the march towards denuclearization, this is an acceptable place for us to be.


QUESTION: One of the things that I think the President has not gotten enough credit for, I was arguing even before President Trump got elected, he doesn’t want a trade deal. He’s the consummate, never-ending negotiator. And yeah, we’ve had some really horrible trade deals over the years, but if you don’t take the strong position that we will fight back and that we will put tariffs on you, I don’t think anybody would take any word seriously. So the President has successfully now done that with Mexico and with Canada. Now it’s going on with our European allies. He’s even renegotiating the contribution of other countries as it relates to NATO. But I think the biggest showdown is with China and with their economy falling, what, 30, 35 percent. I’m guessing China’s going to be banging down Donald Trump’s door soon wanting a trade deal.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Sean, this has been an enormous success for the administration. To create wealth and jobs for American people, we need other countries to trade fairly with us. His raising the specter of tariffs has caused these countries to change their behavior, to be willing to engage in negotiations they would not otherwise have been prepared to engage in. You can say the same thing on the national security front, too. You mentioned NATO, but in the Middle East as well we’ve gotten our partners to share more of the burden of their own defense, and that’s the appropriate place. America’s there. We understand our interests, but these other countries have a responsibility to secure their own people and their own nations and protect their own sovereignty. Our responsibility is to keep the American people safe and secure.


QUESTION: Well, it made no sense for the United States to pay 72 cents of every dollar in terms of protecting the NATO alliance, and then some of our NATO partners, in the case of Germany and Chancellor Merkel, going ahead and doing billion-dollar deals with Russia, which would make them rich again and also he would have control over the lifeblood of their economy there.


	What is the overall relationship with China like? And as it relates to China, Russia, the United States, where are those – where are their alliances going now?


SECRETARY POMPEO: China, I think, Sean, you have correctly identified as the most important long-term strategic challenge for the United States of America, and that’s across multiple fronts. We’ve talked about trade. We need that to be fair and reciprocal with them. But just this week we indicted 10 Chinese for stealing intellectual property. It’s been going on in previous administrations for decades. This is really important to American business and protecting the human capital, the talented work of American people, and national security. We’ve seen --


QUESTION: I know somebody this has happened to. They literally just steal patents. They just steal them.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Absolutely, Sean. And they do it through cyber means or by extorting it. If a business wants to sell into their market, they require them to turn over some or all of their intellectual property. These are unacceptable behaviors that Donald Trump has made clear, that President Trump has made clear he will not accept, and we’re working to correct them.


QUESTION: Oh, I hope that gets done. What is the status of the relationship the United States now has with Putin and Russia? I mean, the media loves to fixate and focus on it. There was no Russia collusion unless you consider the phony dossier that was bought and paid for by Hillary that was disseminated to the American people on a FISA court, but I’m not going to drag you into that mess. But what is the relationship with Putin now?


SECRETARY POMPEO: It’s been a real challenge, but President Trump’s made clear he wants very much to have a good relationship with the Russians. We need them to do a handful of things to change the behavior there. They’re causing challenges, trouble, reducing America’s security. We’ve seen this – the work. We need them to come back into compliance with their missile treaties, agreements that they’ve made as well. If we can convince them and we should have dialogue with them – I did when I was CIA director; I spoke with my Russian counterpart – if we can have conversations that can cause them to change their behavior in a way that doesn’t put Americans at risk, this is an enormously good thing. And I have encouraged the President and other cabinet members to do exactly that.


QUESTION: Last thing. We’ve learned an awful lot about – going back over many, many years how America has been assaulted in cyber warfare. And at some point, you build a sword, then somebody builds a shield. As I understand it, we have 250,000 IT employees that work for our government and yet still, our government agencies we hear, we read are hacked. And to me, that is just unacceptable because we know the threat is real. Are we taking the steps to fix that?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Sean, I think we are. It is a space where offense is easier to play than defense. I think America’s commercial sector has seen that as well. So it is – I think it’s a permanent part of the world in which we live. We’re going to have to continue to expend the resources necessary to protect especially our most sensitive assets, especially that information which is most important to be kept private. We need to spare no cost to prevent it from being hacked, stolen, disrupted, destroyed. We’re --


QUESTION: I don’t think anybody ever had any idea, but I mean, it’s been going on 40 years apparently.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Forty years now.


QUESTION: Now that I’m getting a – oh, it’s crazy. Last question. The caravan, the President’s comments, Mexico. You’ve been active and involved in --


SECRETARY POMPEO: Yep.


QUESTION: -- talking to Mexican officials. What I don’t understand in the whole equation is why haven’t they turned the people around and said no, you can’t stay here either? I know they’ve offered jobs in southern Mexico for some of the caravan – offering work permits to some people. They’ve turned down public – turned off public transportation, but they’re still letting them walk.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Sean, it’s a difficult challenge. The President has got this right. Securing our southern border, enforcing American sovereignty is an enormous national security issue. It’s why, as Secretary of State, I’ve been very involved in these discussions. We’re encouraging – I’ve spoken to the leaders of the three Northern Triangle countries in the last 48 hours. I’ve spoken – spoke with my counterpart down in Mexico and the incoming counterpart down in Mexico nearly every day. We are – encourage them to do all the things they can to break up these migrants.


	And more importantly, Sean, these caravans are a symptom. We have a continuing problem there separate and apart from the caravans, and we need to make sure everyone understands there’s only one way to enter the United States. It is legally. And if you come here illegally, you won’t be able to stay. President Trump’s made that very clear and I am hoping that will assist in deterring people from making this arduous, dangerous travel through Mexico trying to enter our country unlawfully. It’s unacceptable for them to try and come not through a legal port of entry.


QUESTION: Well, I think you’re one of the President’s best picks both as CIA director, now as Secretary of State. What did you graduate from West Point? What were you in your class?


SECRETARY POMPEO: (Laughter.) I was a pretty good student, Sean.


QUESTION: You don’t want to – how come the President said he’s number one in his class, he was number one? Anyway, great to talk to you, Mr. Secretary.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Thank you, Sean.


QUESTION: I know you’ve been traveling a lot on behalf of the country and it looks like we’re making a lot of good progress, and that’s good for all of us. Thank you for what you’re doing.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Amen. Bless you, Sean. Have a good day.


QUESTION: You too. Have a great day.

QUESTION: Secretary Pompeo, Tony Katz. Great to be with you, sir.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Hey, Tony. How are you?


QUESTION: I am doing well. I imagine my day is not as busy as yours. What I want to kind of get into: America is focused on midterm elections. You’re focused on probably in many ways some equally or if not a bigger subject. And I want to start in a conversation of Iran, because with the murder of Jamal Khashoggi, the contributor there at The Washington Post, Iran has become a front-and-center subject again. Saudi Arabia, of course, and the murder there of Khashoggi there in the embassy in Turkey, but it’s been a conversation about the U.S. relationship with Saudi Arabia and how that works in dealing with what I believe we still think of as public enemy number one, which is Iran. Is Iran the top threat to the United States, and how does the relationship with Saudi Arabia play into it?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Let me begin with the relationship between Iran and America national security, the safety of American people. This country – Tony, you’ll know this – is the world’s largest state sponsor of terror. Just these past weeks, we’ve seen them try to assassinate people, conduct assassinations in Europe. These are the hallmarks of a regime that has inflicted enormous instability in the Middle East, and it is the primary reason that President Trump thought the JCPOA was such an awful deal and has chosen to withdraw, and why on Monday of the week ahead we will reimpose the harshest sanctions ever having been in place on the Islamic Republic of Iran.


	And the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has been a great partner with us in pushing back on the Iranian regime in an effort to change its behavior by assisting and ensuring that there is sufficient crude oil in the marketplace, for all the crude oil that the Iranian regime will no longer be able to sell in order to fund its terror campaign across the world.


QUESTION: I think that’s the part people have a hard time squaring the circle on. Saudi Arabia, our partner – when Saudi Arabia engaged this murder in a way that could only be described as amateurish, and that’s me being kind, and Saudi Arabia regarding September 11th – how do we still qualify it as a friendship and a worthwhile relationship?


SECRETARY POMPEO: So we’ve made very clear – President Trump has made very clear – that the murder of Jamal Khashoggi is completely unacceptable. It’s out of bounds; it’s not the way nations behave. The Saudi leadership has said the same thing. We and they are engaged in a fact-finding campaign. We will do our own work to make sure we understand precisely what happened, and we have made a commitment to holding accountable those responsible for the murder of Jamal Khashoggi.


	But in addition to that, we also recognize a long-time, deep set of strategic relationships with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. They are the custodian for the two holy sites. They are partners in commerce. They provide enormous opportunities for Americans to grow their businesses and for wealth creation here in the United States, and they have been a solid partner for the Trump administration is countering terrorism all across the world. Those are important American national security interests, and we can’t lose sight of that.


QUESTION: Talking to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. The other part of that equation is Turkey. You’re talking about between the Turks and Iran a desire for hegemony in the area. Turkey has been continually, under President Erdogan, Eastern-looking, as opposed to being Western-looking as a NATO nation. Does there come a moment where Turkey’s future as a NATO nation and as an ally comes into question?


SECRETARY POMPEO: I hope not. It would be unfortunate for NATO; it’d be unfortunate for the United States, and I think even more unfortunate for the people of Turkey if that were to become the case. It’s been a challenging relationship during the Trump administration’s first year and a half, to be sure, but there have also been places where we’ve had real important successes. We are working together in parts of Syria today to deny terrorists safe haven, terrorists who have, in fact, plotted to attack U.S. civil aviation. These are important American interests.


	We are hopeful that Turkey and President Erdogan will come to understand the U.S. is a better partner than Iran, and the direction that President Erdogan ought to go is to support deeper relationships with the United States and with Europe and with NATO. And if we can do that, Turkey can be a bulwark to prevent America from becoming threatened by terrorists in the region.


QUESTION: Let’s talk about – move it to where I would believe – and you’ll correct me if I’m wrong, sir – our two largest potential, if not actual, geopolitical foes: Russia and China. And part of what I believe we’re seeing is a little bit of a return to more of a Henry Kissinger type theory that you don’t get anywhere by not having a relationship with people; try to have relationships with people, specifically these two nations, so the other nation is more inclined to have a relationship with you.


	In Russia, you still have a question about what’s happening in the Ukraine. You have conversations about how they’re trying to move into some of those Estonian nations. With China, it’s the Spratly Islands, and trying to maintain control of the South China Sea, the Yellow Sea, and therefore build military dominance China is looking for. Who’s the bigger threat? Where should Americans be paying more of their attention, I should say?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Tony, it’s a really good question. I try to avoid ranking and prioritizing but rather just talking about the differences and the threats between those two countries. Russia is a much smaller economy, but still maintains an enormously large nuclear arsenal, which threatens not only the United States but the world. President Trump has been really tough. We have done things to put pressure on Vladimir Putin and Russia in a way that no previous administration has.


	But to you point, we have also tried to find places where we can find common interests with Russia and with Vladimir Putin. I did it when I was CIA director on counterterrorism. We’re trying to do this in different places so that we can have a relationship so that we hopefully can turn the nature of Russia, where they will cease these kinds of activities that are so troubling: interference in our elections or efforts to do so, the efforts that they’re making in Ukraine. We’re trying to push back against those and demonstrate to Russia that the benefit to those activities is not outweighed by the enormous cost that will be imposed if they continue them.


	On China, conversely, this is a long-term challenge. This challenge is across every front. President Trump began taking on the challenge of unfair trade. We have very, very unfair trade with China and have had for many administrations, and he said enough. Fair and reciprocal trade is going to be demanded, and President Trump is determined to achieve that.


	And then we have other sets of challenges, China’s continued efforts in the South China Sea. Just this week, ten Chinese were indicted for stealing intellectual property, aviation-related intellectual property. These are not the types of actions that countries that truly want to be part of the global community engage in, and we’re pushing back against China across every one of those fronts to try and achieve that on behalf of the American people.


QUESTION: You brought up the trade war, sir. Tech stocks here in the U.S. – their worst month since 2008. NASDAQ dropping 9.2 percent in October. And in the Dow, there’s a conversation about jitters regarding a possible trade war with China. Does that play into your figuring and factoring in dealing with China? The people of my state of Indiana paying very close attention to those tariffs and to this trade war.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Yeah. President Trump’s been very clear. We understand that there are risks to the American people. We’re going to make sure that those don’t take place. And I’m convinced that the policies that we’re engaging will benefit the people of Indiana. I’m – Tony, I’m from Kansas – some of the same sets of interests from the state from which I hail as well.


	We are very confident that the policies that we develop with China, the trading relationship that we develop with China, will be better for not only tech companies but for agricultural interests, for industrial interests, for producers of real goods in the United States, in the heartland of America, in places like Indiana and like Kansas. They’ll have real access to an enormously big and growing market in China in a way that we’ve never had for them before. Our determination is to make sure that our producers here in America have the opportunity to compete with Chinese companies on a fair and level playing field, and we’re very confident that the citizens of Indiana and businesses of Indiana will be successful when we achieve that.


QUESTION: Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. Sir, a pleasure. Hope to have you back.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Thank you very much, sir. Have a good day.

",Interview With Tony Katz of Tony Katz Today,http://www.state.gov/secretary/remarks/2018/11/287057.htm
"November 1, 2018","
QUESTION: Welcome back to the Lars Larson Show. It’s a pleasure to be with you. We’ll get to your calls a bit later, but it is my great pleasure to welcome to the program the Secretary of State of the United States Mike Pompeo. Mr. Secretary, thank you for the time today.


SECRETARY POMPEO: It’s great to be back on your show, Lars.


QUESTION: Well, and it’s great to be – to have a man who’s doing a fantastic job for a fantastic President. Let’s start with some of the top-of-the-line issues right now. Let’s start with Yemen. You want to see Yemen stop this civil war right now because it’s putting us in a very tough spot with the Saudis. And then we can talk about the murder of Mr. Khashoggi as well.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Look, we need a peaceful resolution in Yemen. All parties – the Iranians, the Houthis, everyone needs to lay down their arms, begin a political resolution, and restore order and stop the civil war there in Yemen. It’s in the people of Yemen’s best interests, in the Middle East’s best interests, and it’s certainly in America and the world’s best interests as well. And so we’re hopeful that Martin Griffiths, who is leading the reconciliation effort, can get everyone to do that and then have a conversation about how to move forward in Yemen.


QUESTION: I mean, because we’ve got a war there that Saudi’s involved in, and they want our help in it. There’ve been 17,000 people killed and eight million people are on the edge of starvation. But does this put us in a tough spot when we’re also dealing with this side issue of the murder of Jamal Khashoggi?


SECRETARY POMPEO: No, I mean, we’ve been working on this issue in Yemen for some time. Lars, don’t forget – and I hope your listeners won’t forget either – we still have a substantial threat from al-Qaida in Yemen. This is separate from the civil war, but it is something that gets talked about less. You still have al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula operating from that space, and America, along with its partners in the Middle East, working to prevent those threats. They – largely threats to civil aviation that have emanated from that region from getting – from being successful against American interests.


QUESTION: Mr. Secretary, let’s talk about Iran, still in the region. Where do we stand in this? I mean, I was glad to see the President pull out of the Iran deal. It was a bad deal for America and a bad deal for the world, but where do we stand with that country now?


SECRETARY POMPEO: It was a bad deal. The President pulled out of the JCPOA in May. I had opposed it when I was a member of Congress; I didn’t think it made sense. So I think the President has the right end of the stick. I think we’re moving in the right direction.


	On Monday, in front of us, all of the sanctions that had been relieved by the Obama administration will return. And that’s important, because Iran remains – after a couple years plus of the JCPOA, they still remain the world’s largest state sponsor of terror. They continue to produce better and better missiles that can threaten the Middle East and eventually potentially Europe as well. These are not the kinds of behaviors of a normal nation. And so President Trump has made clear that the United States will apply pressure to the Iranian regime to change that behavior, to act like a normal country, and stop threatening the world. And when they do, we’re happy to let them rejoin the community of nations.


QUESTION: All right. I’m talking to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. But if Europe is still doing business with them, but our sanctions land Monday – and I’m sure that because they knew the date they were going to land, they’ve already been to some extent anticipated – if Europe is still – and many European countries are still doing business with them, are the sanctions going to have as much effect on Iran?


SECRETARY POMPEO: I’m convinced these sanctions are going to have an enormous impact on the Iranian leadership. And most European countries – in spite of the UK, Germany, and France having determined that they want to stay inside the JCPOA, in spite of that, nearly every significant European company has already fled Iran. So while their governments say it’s okay to do business there, they know. They know the President’s words, which are that if you choose to do business with Iran, that is your choice, but if you do you won’t do business with America as well. You have to choose between us. And the history, since May, now almost six months on, is that most European companies are choosing – not surprisingly – to do business with America. So I’m very confident these sanctions will have their intended effect.


QUESTION: No doubt. Mr. Secretary, what would the mullahs have to do to satisfy both you and President Trump that they’ve decided to rejoin the community of nations and not be this terror sponsor, and also the nuclear ambitions they still seem to have? What would they have to say or do?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Lars, we’ve laid out 12 items. And 12 may seem like a lot to some, but frankly these are simple asks, asks like cease firing missile into the Middle East; stop arming Hizballah, which threatens Israel; cease engaging in terror activities in Europe. I don’t know if you saw, just yesterday or the day before Denmark arrested an Iranian official who was plotting an assassination attempt in Europe. Stop those kinds of things.


	And on the nuclear file, we’ve asked them to do what, frankly, was the United States official position until the previous administration caved, which is cease their nuclear activity. We’re happy to provide them with the energy that they need, but cease their nuclear activity in a way that doesn’t create proliferation risk throughout the world.


QUESTION: Do you have any doubt that they are still trying to pursue nuclear weapons at this point?


SECRETARY POMPEO: So what I can say is this: The Islamic Republic of Iran has refused to do the kinds of things which are the hallmark of countries that truly want to have a peaceful nuclear program and who don’t have the intention or at least want to have the capacity to use their nuclear tools in a way that harms the world.


QUESTION: Mr. Secretary, let’s move to North Korea. You did a lot of the preparatory work for President Trump. You were there on the frontlines. Where do we stand in that? I mean, it seemed as though we got some fairly substantial movement, more movement than I think anybody’s seen in 25 years, despite all the accommodations that have been made for that country over the last 25 years. President Trump drew a hardline and he pushed back when North Korea pushed back, and I think North Korea got the message. But where do we stand there today?


SECRETARY POMPEO: We have made real progress on North Korea. There still remains an awful lot to do; I’ll concede that. But no one thought this would either be easy, straightforward without some complexity, nor did anybody think this would be quick. Remember, we’re only a few months past the June summit. This has been a problem that’s gone on for decades.


	We have convinced North Korea not to test fire their missiles. They haven’t conducted a nuclear test. They returned a number of remains of American fallen soldiers. I’m hopeful there will be more to follow. And they have dismantled a couple of facilities, which we are hopeful we will get a chance to actually conduct verification on before too long as well. There still remains an awful lot of their nuclear program that needs to be dismantled and verified. We’re working to bring those steps forward.


	But make no mistake, President Trump’s been clear. The economic sanctions will not be lifted until such time as we have had the capacity to verify that they have eliminated their nuclear program.


QUESTION: I mean, there have been times that the leader of North Korea, the dictator, has been very vocal, very belligerent, very much on the world stage. Lately, he seems to have been quiet. Am I misreading that he’s being quiet because he is finally getting with the program, or is he being quiet because he’s got something else up his sleeve?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Goodness, it’s all about verification. I was there a few weeks back. I met with Chairman Kim. He reiterated his commitment to denuclearize. We made a little progress on what the next steps ought to look like. I’m hopeful we’ll have a summit before too long, where we’ll make another substantial step along the way. Only time will tell.


	What I want your listeners to know is, unlike previous administrations that have begun negotiations, grown weary of them, and then have provided North Korea with a whole bunch of money, this administration has no intention of allowing that to happen.


QUESTION: Let me ask you about one other issue, and that is Mexico. I understand that the President is taking the lead on that. I understand that in this – at this point, who knows. But does diplomacy play a role in negotiating with Mexico with regard to the caravan that’s coming north toward the border? The President has said as recently as yesterday 10-15,000 troops down on our border to send the message: Don’t try to come in illegally. Where does diplomacy play a role, if any, in this at this point?


SECRETARY POMPEO: It certainly does, Lars. We are not going to permit these caravans to come across our border. They will not be permitted to enter. Diplomacy comes in in multiple, as I talk to my counterpart there nearly every day about the progress that’s being made and how it is that we can do the right things here in America so that Mexico can do the right things to ensure that these Hondurans, El Salvadorians, Guatemalans, and others don’t transit their country and enter the United States. So we spend a lot of time. It’s a foreign policy issue. It’s a national security issue. The President’s made that abundantly clear. And so there is a diplomatic element into urging these countries to do the right thing and prevent this unlawful entry into the United States.


QUESTION: And as a matter of international law, Mr. Secretary, now that they’re in a country that has said – Mexico has said we’ll give you safe haven here; we can – you can stay here; you can work here; you can make your home here. They’re not truly refugees or asylees, are they?


SECRETARY POMPEO: It is the case the Mexican Government has been very generous in offering them an opportunity to stay and to work and to receive the benefits of having done that work. It certainly changes the legal context, in my judgment. But more importantly, I think it makes clear to these people who are traveling that heading to the United States is the wrong thing to do; it won’t be successful. There are alternatives that will permit them and their families to have better lives. And so they should cease their movement towards the United States and either return to the country from which they came or follow the procedures that Mexico has put in place, which will permit many of them – indeed, nearly all of them – to stay in Mexico.


QUESTION: Mr. Secretary, I have to tell you personally, as an American, it is a great pleasure to see a man who’s on the same page as a great President, doing great work, and representing people, going to far-flung exotic places like North Korea. God bless you for what you’re doing, and thank you.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Thank you, Lars. Bless you, too. Have a great day.


QUESTION: Take care now. That’s Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.

QUESTION: Secretary of State Mike Pompeo with us this afternoon on KMOX. Mr. Secretary, how are you?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Good afternoon, Mark. I’m good. How are you doing today?


QUESTION: Good. Thanks for coming on. Let me get right to it here because we have a variety of issues. Can you explain what’s happening in Yemen right now and why – I guess one of the questions would be why folks here in my listening area should pay attention or how this plays into the broader issue with foreign policy.


SECRETARY POMPEO: So two things. First, in Yemen, al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula continues there to plot terror attacks on the United States of America. The United States is involved in order to prevent those. We’ve been very successful to date at disrupting those terror plots. We sometimes take for granted the fact that we’ve not had terror attacks from al-Qaida here in the United States for a bit, but that’s due to a lot of hard work, much of which is taking place today in Yemen.


	Second, we have Iran very active in Yemen. Iran, the world’s largest state sponsor of terror, continues to provide missiles and artillery that threatens Western interests throughout the Middle East. It’s those very real threats to the United States that cause us to have an interest in making sure that the American people are safe and secure.


QUESTION: And this sort of plays into the topic of Iran sanctions, and you’re imposing new sanctions. These are called snapback sanctions. What’s the goal here? What are we trying to accomplish overall?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Iran continues to proliferate missiles. Just this week in Denmark an Iranian intelligence officer was arrested for having attempted an assassination attack inside of Europe. These kinds of things could most certainly impact American citizens traveling, business people doing business in Europe. This remains the world’s largest state sponsor of terror.


	The previous administration had entered into the JCPOA. President Trump said, and I agree with him, it was among the worst deals ever struck by the United States. And so the President withdrew back in May, and now this coming Monday we will reimpose the sanctions that were in place before that deal was entered into, which will deny Iran the money they need to continue to foment terror around the world.


QUESTION: So they – I’m sure they want to get around those sanctions. They’re trying to make financial ties with other countries. Do you think they can do that successfully?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Well, the six months since the withdrawal from the JCPOA would indicate that they’re going to have a real challenge in doing that. Nearly all of the major companies that were doing business in Iran – European companies, Asian companies, countries frankly from around the world that had their businesses doing work in Iran – have withdrawn from that country. And so I think they will be incredibly challenged to continue to do business with the rest of the world. The President has made this point very clearly: You can choose to do business with Iran or with the United States, but you cannot do both.


QUESTION: So if the sanctions result in the pressure that you’re hoping for, what do you hope that the reaction then from the Iranians will be?


SECRETARY POMPEO: We hope they’ll behave like a normal nation – stop conducting assassination plots in Europe, stop launching missiles into Saudi Arabia and the Emirates, cease their activities all around the world in supporting Hizballah that risks – puts at risk Israeli lives every day and Americans who are traveling to Israel as well. The kinds of activities we’re asking them to cease, they’re no different, Mark, than what we ask every country in the world to do. Behave like a normal nation, and then you are welcome to rejoin the community of nations.


QUESTION: And that sounds like it makes sense, but with Iran in particular we haven’t seen them behaving in a way in the past to indicate that that would be something that they would do moving forward. Have we?


SECRETARY POMPEO: We haven’t seen that. But one of the reasons we haven’t is because the previous administration took an approach where it thought that it could work with Iran, it thought that if it opened up and cut a deal with them that the ayatollah would change his ways. That has proven to be patently false. Indeed the risk to the world from Iran increased during the JCPOA, and this administration is determined not to repeat that.


	We’re going to be diligent. These sanctions are not aimed at the Iranian people. Indeed, it is the Iranian people who we are supporting, and we hope that it will be the Iranian people that will demand that their government simply do the things that we’ve asked, to behave like a normal country.


QUESTION: Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is with me on KMOX this afternoon talking about a variety of foreign policy topics. Have you heard the audio tape of Khashoggi being killed yet?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Mark, I have not.


QUESTION: What’s the next step in that situation? Obviously we have jobs on the line here. It’s a tough situation because you have to balance human rights versus the economic reality. Boeing here in St. Louis, there are big defense contracts. How do you navigate these waters?


SECRETARY POMPEO: So we have deep and long-term strategic relationships with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, and at the same time the murder of Jamal Khashoggi in the consulate in Turkey is unacceptable. President Trump has made clear that it violates all norms, and we don’t – we neither condone it, nor will we permit it to go unresponded to.


	So with respect – you asked with respect to next steps. We’re continuing to understand the fact pattern. We are reviewing putting sanctions on the individuals that we have been able to identify to date that have – that were engaged in that murder. It’ll take us probably a handful more weeks before we have enough evidence to actually put those sanctions in place, but I think we’ll be able to get there. We’re going to find the fact pattern. The President said we will demand accountability for those who were involved in the commission of this heinous crime.


	At the same time, President Trump has made very clear not only do we have important commercial relationships, but important strategic relationships, national security relationships with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, and we intend to make sure that those relationships remain intact.


QUESTION: Are you satisfied with the level of cooperation right now in that investigation with the Saudis?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Yes. We’re getting cooperation. We’ve had good cooperation with Turkey as well. And frankly, there’s been good cooperation between Turkey and Saudi Arabia, although sometimes uneven. There’s been good cooperation there as well. So yes, we’re continuing to develop the fact pattern, as are other countries around the world. We’ll form our own judgments about who should be held accountable for that murder.


QUESTION: You’ve been racking up some frequent flier miles to North Korea. I think you’ve been there four times already. There hasn’t really been a breakthrough. What’s the status of those negotiations, or what might happen? There’s still talk of a summit next year, another summit. What can you tell us about that?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Yes, sir. Well, we’ve made some progress, right? We stopped their missile testing. There is no longer nuclear tests being conducted. Those are really dangerous activities, and the North Koreans have stopped them.


	We’ve had – they have closed down a couple of sites. We have been told that we will get to inspect those sites shortly. Chairman Kim told me that himself. I’m hopeful that that will take place before too long as well.


	And then we are continuing our negotiations not only, as Americans have seen, on the return of the remains of our fallen there in North Korea – a very important thing that we shouldn’t underestimate either, at least the beginning of that. It is very important to those families.


	But we’re working diligently to complete what Chairman Kim and President Trump agreed to back in June, which is the complete and verifiable denuclearization of North Korea. No one ever thought it would be easy, straightforward, or quick, and so we’re working to put the next steps in place so we can begin to take real, measurable, impactful steps, reducing North Korea’s nuclear threat. And when we’re done, when we get to the end, President Trump wants there to be a brighter future for the North Korean people. We’re determined to get to that point.


QUESTION: Obviously this is a trust but verify situation, but why should we believe that the North truly wants to give up those nuclear weapons?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Well, he said that he will. We’ll have to verify it. We have to see it. Your point is well taken. No one should for a moment believe that President Trump or me or this administration is going to take anyone’s word for this. We’ll need to see it. We’ll need to know it. And once we’ve had the capacity, the opportunity to verify that this has taken place, then and only then will the economic sanctions that have been put on North Korea be removed.


QUESTION: Mr. Secretary, thanks so much for joining me here in St. Louis. Appreciate that.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Thank you, Mark.


QUESTION: What’s a tougher job, CIA director or Secretary of State? You’ve had two non-stressful jobs.


SECRETARY POMPEO: They’re both incredible privileges to serve America, Mark.


QUESTION: I thought that might be the answer. Mr. Secretary, Mike Pompeo, thank you so much.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Thank you, sir.


QUESTION: Appreciate it.

QUESTION: And of course, when it comes to Governor Scott, he wants to be the next senator. With us right now, a man who used to do politics for a living, Congressman Mike Pompeo, now has turned into – from CIA Director Mike Pompeo to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.


	Mr. Secretary, welcome to the Brian Kilmeade Show.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Good morning, Brian. How are you today?


QUESTION: Man, your resume’s getting better and better. This is obviously with a most challenging job. Today is an important day in U.S.-Iranian relations. Tell us why.


SECRETARY POMPEO: So we are now just a handful of days from all of the sanctions that the previous administration had relieved against Iran snapping back, coming back into effect, and it’s having a real impact on the Iranian leadership. This is important. The Iranians are – just yesterday or the day before, Denmark announced that Iran had plotted an assassination attack in their country. Same has happened in France and Albania. They are the world’s largest state sponsor of terror and they are squandering the people’s money, the Iranian people’s money, on these silly malign activities. And our effort is to get them to change that behavior.


QUESTION: Well, I mean, let’s talk about what you just glazed over, an assassination attempt inside Denmark and now the Danes are asking for the European Union to take action. Could you tell us more about this?


SECRETARY POMPEO: So that’s right. So an Iranian intelligence officer was in Denmark seeking to conduct an assassination attempt inside of Europe on the EU’s soil. This is the third effort of just recent times. There’s a long history of this. We talk about assassinations around the world. The Iranians are the leading actor conducting these assassination attempts in Europe and that kind of behavior needs to stop, and we have offered our support and effort to help the Europeans in preventing these kinds of assassination attempts from taking place.


QUESTION: So back to what led to the JCPOA, which is an agreement the President promised to rip up that you didn’t like when you were congressman and now it’s gone. Now, there was no obvious breach of this agreement according to the United Nations by the Iranians, but this time it’s harder for you because the deal was done, the Russians were on board with the sanctions, as were the Chinese, as was the European Union. But now once they signed onto this, they’re reluctant to sign off of this. How hard a job has it been to try to get, number one, our allies of the EU to step away with us?


SECRETARY POMPEO: So, so far, Brian, the Europeans have stayed in the deal. They’ve taken a fundamentally different position than ours. But we talk to them nearly every day. We’re working with them to explain things like what just happened in Denmark yesterday and why we have to have a completely different policy with respect to Iran. The problems – and the President has talked about this at great length – the challenge of the worst deal ever was that it didn’t address Iranian missile programs, it didn’t address Iranian terror, it did none of those things. And you can see the fruits of that today where Iran is running rampant in Syria and in Iraq and in other places in the Middle East. That’s the reason that the JCPOA made no sense and the reason President Trump made the bold decision to withdraw from it.


QUESTION: So the Iranian foreign minister was on CBS, Mohammad Zarif, and he’s got a problem with this – with the Trump administration and you. Cut one.


	(An audio clip was played)


QUESTION: So what do you think he’s talking about?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Boy, it’s difficult to know. We know this: This is not the first time that Mr. Zarif has made threats against the United States. President Trump has been unambiguous that we will defend American interests all around the world, and that what we’re looking for is Iran to become a normal nation. We’re not asking for much, Brian, right? We’re asking the same thing of Iran that we ask for every nation. Don’t cause trouble, don’t commit terror acts around the world, don’t engage in this kind of malign activity.


	We are hopeful that Zarif’s boss, the ayatollah, the man who actually makes all the decisions – it’s not Mr. Zarif, it’s the ayatollah – that the ayatollah will see the error of his ways and will come to understand that it’s in Iran’s best interest to change the nature of the activities that Iran is conducting all around the world and become a normal nation.


	When they do, President Trump’s made very clear we’re happy to talk with the Iranians and bring them back into the community of nations, but they’ve got to do about a dozen things, simple things like stop launching missiles into airports in the Middle East, before such things – such a thing can take place.


QUESTION: Any indication – have they reached out to you guys at all that they might be willing to talk at any level?


SECRETARY POMPEO: We’ve seen no indications of any change in their behavior, Brian. None at all.


QUESTION: A lot of focus on Saudi Arabia, their archenemy in the region. You’re either in the Iranian camp or the Saudi camp, and that camp has gotten really muddy and murky. MBS, as commonly known, the crown prince, a 33-year-old, you met with him, you talked to the king about the murder of Jamal Khashoggi. Now everyone admits what we were able to figure out almost immediately and Bob Corker said the day it happened, that he was brutally murdered by a hit squad. Is there any doubt in your mind the prince knew?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Look, the death of Jamal Khashoggi is tragic. It’s an awful thing that took place. The killing, the murder of Jamal Khashoggi in the consulate in Turkey violates the norms of international law. That much is very, very clear. What we’ve asked the Saudis to do and the Turks to do, the place which the murder took place, is to help us continue to develop the facts, that there are still many unanswered questions about precisely how this came to be. We are working diligently, our team, to get the facts, the facts that the Americans can learn. We won’t rely on others; we’ll take their information, we’ll make sure and develop our fact pattern.


	But Brian, I want to remind your listeners there are long – since FDR, long, strategic relationships with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Military, commercial ties, important relationships with the United States of America. And it’s very important for us to keep that in mind as we continue to ensure that accountability is had for all those who were involved in committing this murder.


QUESTION: Right. If you look at what he’s done with the prime minister of Lebanon, if you look at what he did at the Ritz-Carlton, jailing the family until they did exactly what he wanted, they say the haphazard way in which they’re conducting the war in Yemen and the way they have isolated Qatar – a lot of people say this is a type of leadership under this 33-year-old prince that – irresponsible, that we really can’t get behind.


	In fact, General Michael Hayden says this: “The only way to salvage [this] relationship between the United States and Saudi Arabia is to curtail the relationship with Mohammed bin Salman. America obviously does not get to pick [their] future Saudi kings, but we do get to choose how we relate to one.”


	Are you going to re-evaluate, if not – you just told me you’re not going to break, but are you going to re-evaluate that relationship because of his recent actions?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Brian, we’ve got to see where the facts ultimately lead us. We truly have a responsibility to America, to the American people, to ensure that we have a good relationship with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. To General Hayden’s point, the people of Saudi Arabia are an important partner for the United States, and we’re working to make sure we have the right – the facts right. I’ve spoken to the king a couple of times, I’ve spoken with MBS, I’ve spoken with their foreign minister, my direct counterpart, al-Jubeir, on numerous occasions. I think the Saudis share our view. They understand that they’ve got to get these facts out, and that time is not on their side in doing so.


QUESTION: Now let’s switch, if we can. I know we have a couple more minutes. The Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, with us. It’s hard to imagine, on more levels, America confronting China. The backlash is building around the world in China because they come in with a lot of money and they basically build up certain things, lend money to countries, and they become hostage to them. An example now: Pakistan’s beginning to push back on the debt trap, so to speak. Brazil, the same thing. Now we understand the – one of their ships got within 45 yards of one of ours, and China’s leader, President Xi, reportedly put his military advisors overseeing operations in the South China Sea on high alert last week. He says it’s necessary to strengthen the mission and concentrate preparations for fighting a war.


	I mean, we have two superpowers staring each other down. Where is this heading, Mr. Secretary?


SECRETARY POMPEO: So I think President Trump and our National Security Strategy are spot on. I think we’ve got it just right. We are in a competition with China. You identified a handful of things. Just this week our Department of Justice indicted 10 folks from China for having stolen intellectual property related to the aviation industry. This is a behavior that is inappropriate, it’s not consistent with being a superpower or a leader in the world. Stealing another country’s intellectual property, something China’s been engaged in to the tune of hundreds of billions of dollars, is just something China has to figure out a way to stop. And President Trump is the first president in some time who was prepared to say we’re going to have fair and reciprocal trade, we’re going to continue to build our military so that there is no challenge that we can’t meet, and we’re not going to allow China to continue to steal our intellectual property.


QUESTION: Mr. Secretary, I know you have to run. My last question is: Do you expect any progress in the G20 to start healing the rift between these nations? Or are we not at the point where talking would even help?


SECRETARY POMPEO: I’m very hopeful that there’ll be good, constructive – to your point – healing conversations at the G20 at the end of November. I’m looking forward to it; I know President Trump is very much looking forward to being there and being with his counterparts from each of those countries.


QUESTION: He is – the Secretary of State Mike Pompeo gave us a few minutes. Thanks, Mr. Secretary. Best of luck.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Brian, thank you. Good luck to you, too. Have a great day.

QUESTION: As the new information coming from Europe where you have these Iranian hit squads roaming about trying to knock off oppositional voices, Denmark, after an assassination plot there foiled, Denmark saying, okay, bring on the sanctions against Iran. And we have a champion in real freedom in the Middle East at our State Department and our White House with President Trump and Mike Pompeo at State, and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo joins us now to give us the latest on these threats that we’re hearing from Iran about the new round of sanctions, and he joins us now.


	Mr. Secretary, good to have you with us.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Hello, Laura. Good to be with you.


QUESTION: So what do you make of that comment from the foreign minister?


SECRETARY POMPEO: So it’s not the first time that Mr. Zarif has made these kinds of threats, but the real decision-making there isn’t him, it’s the ayatollah. That’s who our counterparty is. That’s who is making all of these decisions. You referred to the assassination attempts all throughout Europe. They’re not just the couple from these past months, this has been going on for some time. They’re the world’s largest state sponsor of terror. We saw that their nuclear program continues to present risk to the United States. That’s why the President made the right decision withdrawing from the JCPOA. We ask for one simple thing, right? We want the Islamic Republic of Iran to behave like a normal nation. If they’ll do that, we’re happy to allow them to enter the community of nations, but we have to continue to apply pressure. On Monday on the week ahead, we will put back in place sanctions that will be very severe on the leadership of Iran, and we hope that that will convince them to change their ways.


QUESTION: Mr. Secretary, you have a cold. I can hear it.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Just a bit.


QUESTION: Oh, you poor guy. Well, you’re flying all over creation. (Laughter.) You’re flying all over creation.


SECRETARY POMPEO: I’ll be just fine. No sympathy needed, Laura, but thank you for your concern.


QUESTION: Oh, no, I know. But as a mother, I worry about all my friends who are sick, so thank you for playing sick here with us.


	So right now the Europeans – there’s developing persistence, split in opinion on what to do with this Iranian menace. Where is Germany today given the fact that Merkel is out as her party leader? She’s in her last term. Clearly, opposition forces in Germany, more populist anti-migration political elements.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Laura, so far the German Government has not changed its position. It still wants to stay inside of the JCPOA, but nearly every German company – folks with real money at risk – made the opposite decision. They have fled. They have left. They have decided they are not going to run through the Iranian sanctions that President Trump will put back in place on Monday. And there are other countries in Europe who are with us, and I am convinced that over time all of the European countries will come to see that Iran is indeed the force creating instability in the Middle East and that we must apply all possible pressure to push back against that to fix it.


QUESTION: So the sanctions go in place on Monday, correct?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Yes, ma’am, Monday.


QUESTION: Okay. And they’ll feel them immediately or will it take a little time to settle in?


SECRETARY POMPEO: So, Laura, they’re already feeling them. But as the days go on, the pressure will increase. We will substantially drop the amount of crude oil, their primary revenue source, that they can ship around the world. Treasury will put back in place sanctions on financial institutions there. And we hope that the sanctions we put on individuals and in other places will convince the leadership. We want the Iranian people to be successful. We want this to be a successful country. We want to restore democracy there. We think the Iranian people want that same thing. And so our aim is not to harm the Iranian people, but to change the behavior, the malign activity of this regime.


QUESTION: Just going back to Germany, boy, have Merkel’s fortunes changed. Obviously, she’ll be finishing up her last term, but she’s been there for I guess 13 years or so. And she’s leaving as head of her party. How will that change our dealings with Germany in the near term, and what do you see as the political climate in Europe with the rise of Salvini and the challenges the EU is facing?


SECRETARY POMPEO: So we have many places where the Europeans work alongside us. We clearly have some where we don’t share the same view. The President has been direct with respect to the Europeans taking increased responsibility for their own security. That makes perfect sense. Most European countries understand that. The primary folks who need to defend against the risk that Russia creates reside in Europe not in America. So I’m hopeful as each of these governments evaluate this and sees that America is with them, we’re happy to assist them, but they have the primary responsibility. We hope that each of these governments will come to see that in the way that President Trump has so clearly laid out.


QUESTION: CNBC reported yesterday, Mr. Secretary, that North Korea is reportedly preparing nuclear and missile sites for international inspectors. What can you tell us about – I know you are going to go meet with your North Korean counterpart in just a matter of days, but what’s the latest from North Korea?


SECRETARY POMPEO: So I can’t say much about what’s taking place on the ground, but I can make clear that when I was with Chairman Kim, now three, three and a half weeks ago, he committed to allowing American inspectors to come look at two significant sites. We hope to get them there before too long. It’s one of the things I’ll speak with my counterpart next week about. And then we do have the intention of President Trump and Chairman Kim getting together before too long, hopefully early in the next year, where we can make a substantial breakthrough in taking down the nuclear threat from North Korea. I’m – we’re still happy that they haven’t conducted a nuclear test in an awfully long time and they haven’t launched a missile in an awfully long time, but there’s a lot of work which remains, and Chairman Kim has made clear to me – just as plain as I’m speaking to you, Laura – that he has the intention to denuclearize and we’ll do everything we can to assist him in following through on that commitment.


QUESTION: I want to move to China, Mr. Secretary, because we’ve seen in recent weeks nothing that’s surprising to you or me, because we’ve been following this issue of Chinese stealing our intellectual property and bribing, attempting to bribe foreign officials, including here at different times in the United States – business officials, excuse me – to gain access to technology, critical technology in manufacturing, aviation, and so forth. Now we have this chipmaker ban in place that garnered a lot of attention, and it’s trying to – I guess we’re trying to target that state-owned chipmaker in China over national security concerns. How is that going to fit in to our overall aggressive stance against this expansive Chinese behemoth?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Laura, China is probably, over the long term, the biggest challenge, national security challenge that faces our country. You saw the indictments of 10 Chinese persons for the alleged theft of intellectual property, aviation-related intellectual property. This is a story that’s been going on for years. This is the first administration that has been prepared to push back against China, and we’re doing so on all fronts. So where the semiconductor piece fits in is it’s part of a mosaic of our strategic effort to push back against this continued Chinese effort. It begins with trade. We want, the President has demanded fair and reciprocal trade with China. We’ve demanded that they not steal our intellectual property. We talk with some frequency about the enormous violation of religious freedom that’s taking place against the Uighurs in China. We’re very worried that China will put the people in many countries around the world, in Africa and Central America and Latin America, in a debt trap that will cause those countries decades of pain.


	It is a multipronged effort on behalf of all of the United States Government, at the President’s direction, to convince China to behave like a normal nation on commerce and with respect to the rules of international law.


QUESTION: Yeah. I mean, I know you have to go, Mr. Secretary, but just so people understand this. Our trade policy with China has had a real effect inside China. They already have structural weaknesses within China at large, but they had the weakest manufacturing growth in more than two years in China, and the yuan has slid, manufacturing stalled, and their ambitions as a result have been affected. But they’re still lofty, and we do finally have an administration who’s seeing this with eyes wide open.


	Mr. Secretary, we really appreciate your joining us and best of luck --


SECRETARY POMPEO: Thank you, Laura.


QUESTION: -- on that next meeting with your North Korean counterpart, and get better, get well, okay?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Thank you, Laura. So long.

	The time is now for the cessation of hostilities, including missile and UAV strikes from Houthi-controlled areas into the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. Subsequently, Coalition air strikes must cease in all populated areas in Yemen.


	Substantive consultations under the UN Special Envoy must commence this November in a third country to implement confidence-building measures to address the underlying issues of the conflict, the demilitarization of borders, and the concentration of all large weapons under international observation.


	A cessation of hostilities and vigorous resumption of a political track will help ease the humanitarian crisis as well.

	Today we commemorate the 20th anniversary of the signing of the 1998 International Religious Freedom Act (IRF Act) into law. The IRF Act expanded U.S. foreign policy capabilities to promote and defend religious freedom around the world. It builds on our founding fathers’ firm conviction that the freedom of individuals to believe as they see fit is a God-given right that is central to the success of a nation.


	The protection of religious freedom is central to the Trump administration’s foreign policy, and protecting this human right is an essential part of who we are as Americans. Religious freedom appears first among the rights enumerated in our Constitution. Where religious freedom flourishes, there is greater stability and more economic opportunity.


	In the twenty years since the IRF Act was signed, we have made significant progress. I am proud of the team we have at the State Department, led by Ambassador Brownback, who work tirelessly to advance religious freedom every day. But on this day, we are also mindful of those places around the world where so many are not free to worship or live out their faith as they choose. Today, we reaffirm the inherent worth and dignity found in every person, who are endowed by our Creator with inalienable rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. Though the challenges to religious freedom are daunting, they are not insurmountable, and we will continue to work tirelessly to ensure that all may enjoy this universal freedom.

QUESTION: Welcoming back now the Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. Mr. Secretary, good morning to you.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Good morning, Hugh. How are you today?


QUESTION: I am terrific. I’m over the Pittsburgh plague of laryngitis so I’m so glad that that got done in time.


	Mr. Secretary, in the past two weeks I’ve had on Vice President Pence and National Security Advisor John Bolton and now you. They both indicated a clear turning in our strategic posture vis-a-vis the People’s Republic of China and I wanted to ask: Am I correct in recognizing our public tone is different? And was there a moment where the President said, look, I’m going to be the good cop with President Xi and you three, and Secretary Mattis, you, Mike Pompeo, John Bolton, Vice President, you’re going to be the bad cop? Did that happen at – like, at an NSC meeting?


SECRETARY POMPEO: No, Hugh. The truth of the matter is this has been consistent with the strategy that we’ve had since the beginning of this administration to recognize the competitive nature of the relationship between our two countries, and as China has taken actions that have provided risk to the American people. Whether that’s a risk through the stealing of intellectual property or trade rules that are unfair or activity in the South China Sea or their continued expansion in space and their efforts to develop their military, each of those actions has been met with a strong and vigorous response from the United States of America and we’ll continue to do so. There wasn’t a moment, but rather an administration that has recognized the difference in China’s behavior and the requirement for an American response to that changed behavior.


QUESTION: Secretary Pompeo, you’re a West Point man. Earlier this hour, I had West Point General Stanley McChrystal, retired, on and he talked about the Treasure Fleet of Zheng He and how President Xi is now using that as a rhetorical device about Chinese expansionism across the globe. Do you think he’s got any limit in mind or is this a basically 21st century belongs to China strategy by President Xi?


SECRETARY POMPEO: I think if you go look at President Xi’s stated intentions, you can clearly see that China has a plan that is different than the one that they had five years ago or even two or three years ago. You see this in their ability to use their money around the world. And I’ve spoken to this. I spoke to it when I was in Panama and I travel the world. I remind countries we welcome commercial competition with China on a fair and reciprocal basis, but when China shows up with bribes to senior leaders in countries in exchange for infrastructure projects that will harm the people of that nation, then this idea of a treasury-run empire build is something that I think would be bad for each of those countries and certainly presents risk to American interests, and we intend to oppose them at every turn.


QUESTION: Two more specific questions about China: You are a Secretary of State known for an emphasis on religious liberty around the world, not just at home. The United Nations panel estimates that PRC currently have imprisoned as many as one million Uighurs, but Hong Kong-based human rights groups put the number between two million and three million. The Chinese vehemently deny this. What is the Department of State’s position on what these camps are all about?


SECRETARY POMPEO: These camps are clearly a Chinese effort to reduce the capacity for Chinese people to exercise their religious freedom. We’ve seen it in many different forms. We’ve seen it being more difficult for churches to put crosses on the roofs of their buildings. We’ve seen religious freedom practices be denied in ways that they had not been in years previously. These are real threats to religious freedom, something that President Trump has directed this administration to take seriously. And we’re not only talking about this where countries are denying religious freedom around the world, but beginning to use American efforts and global efforts to push back against these denials of the most basic human rights. Indeed, an International Religious Freedom Day is upon us and is something the State Department will be talking about a great deal.


QUESTION: Now, the other thing that worries me about China is their cyber capabilities. A cyber Pearl Harbor is best prevented, in my view, by dispersed weapons of response and a known will to retaliate. Have we done the former, and is there any doubt about our commitment and ability to do the latter?


SECRETARY POMPEO: There should be no doubt about the latter. We have the capability to respond and we have laid out a strategy in order to respond, and the President has made clear that if a response is required we will take one. And with respect to dispersion, I believe we are much more resilient today than we have ever been at any time when this cyber threat was upon us.


QUESTION: I think the elections are going to prove that the China policy has been very expertly articulated and will be endorsed by the electorate. I think that’s going to happen. We’ll see. There has been a focus on the heinous murder of Jamal Khashoggi, one of my colleagues at The Washington Post, though I didn’t know him – good and necessary. Any news on that front, Mr. Secretary?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Not much news. We continue to learn a little bit more about what transpired and how Mr. Khashoggi was tragically murdered. You saw that the Saudi prosecutors yesterday made clear that this was a premeditated murder that took place, and we’re continuing to learn the facts. The State Department took the step of beginning to do investigations to prosecute those responsible for – or to sanction those responsible for human rights violations that occurred, if the data supports it, and then we have made sure that none of those persons are capable of traveling to the United States.


	The President has made very clear we will hold those responsible accountable, but that America has important, long-term, strategic interest in our relationship with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and that we are going to do both of those things at the same time – protect our interests and hold those responsible accountable.


QUESTION: Now, it is very good and proper that that’s happening. At the same time, some commentators have broadened this murder into the opportunity to attack Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates in Yemen. Can you explain to the audience how Iranian missiles get fired – I think it’s happened 34 times; it might be higher now – from Yemen into Saudi Arabia? And we’re not talking about firecrackers here. We’re talking about ballistic missiles have been launched from Yemen. How do they get there? How do Iranian missiles get there?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Hugh, first the number of ballistic missiles that have left Yemen headed for Saudi Arabia and the Emirates is dozens of times higher than the 36 that you identified.


QUESTION: Wow.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Second, those missiles are coming from and the hardware and software that supports them are coming from the Islamic Republic of Iran. We see it in the hardware, we can tell by the telemetry, and we know by the fact that we have had interdictions at sea which make very clear the source of this. So what you have is a proxy war being engaged in by Iran against Saudi Arabia and the Emirates. It’s something that we’ve made clear what we are going to do our level best to prevent, and we are supporting the Emirates and Saudi Arabia in their efforts to take down these missiles.


	Think, Hugh, if one of these manages to hit – actually hit an aircraft at the Riyadh airport, this will be an enormous economic impact to the United States of America, and could, in fact, kill Americans flying through that international airport. These Iranian efforts are so troubling. We’ve urged our European partners to assist us in pushing back against this activity, and the whole world should understand that Iran is putting commercial, civil aviation at risk by the actions that they have taken.


QUESTION: Now, the export of extraterritorial violence, always condemned by us, and as it should be, as when the Russian GRU agents attacked with the nerve agent in Great Britain, Saudi agents in Turkey. But am I right that the world’s largest exporter of terrorist violence is, in fact, Iran by a magnitude of order above everyone else?


SECRETARY POMPEO: It’s not even close nor is it disputable. Every agency, every UN entity that reports on terrorism identifies Iran as the world’s largest state sponsor of terror. And so a week from now or a little more than a week from now, the most stringent sanctions ever in place against Iran by the United States of America will come back into effect on the morning of the 5th of November.


QUESTION: Well, I see the ongoing wake for the JCPOA everywhere. Ben Rhodes – I like to call him the Metternich of the network I work for, MSNBC, the Metternich of MSNBC – is always quick to blast you and the President for alienating the world and walking away from the JCPOA and pointing to the fact China and Russia haven’t. It’s like an Alice in Wonderland foreign policy, Mr. Secretary. How much time do you have to defend – do you have to spend defending doing obviously necessary steps against the fantasy-land foreign policy, fantasy foreign policy league that they’ve got going over there?


SECRETARY POMPEO: I don’t spend much time thinking about Ben Rhodes. I spend a lot of time thinking about making sure that America is secure and our interests are protected. These very missile launches that you described, the terror that you spoke to, the export of malign influence around the world all took place during the JCPOA and, indeed, in nearly every instance that I just referred to, increased during the time of the JCPOA. It was bad for the United States. The right decision was made by the President to withdraw, and our ask of Iran is just to simply become a normal country. Stop exporting terror, stop using proxy forces to create chaos around the world, and then we will welcome them back into the league of nations. And we’re just – we’re waiting on them to do that.


QUESTION: I am counting on a week from Tuesday being a referendum on that as well as China. And then finally, not as well known, but Governor Rick Scott was my guest this morning. He tells me that Venezuelan expats and the Nicaraguan expats in Florida, with whom he is campaigning and talking and helping in the aftermath of Michael, are still amazed that we allowed Maduro to do what he did over the last 10 years to their country. What is our current policy and how malign an influence is he?


SECRETARY POMPEO: So Maduro has behaved in the way that dictators do and imposed enormous personal anguish on Venezuelans. We now have several million Venezuelans who have fled their country, largely for Colombia but now to other places in South America as well. U.S. policy is very clear. We are supporting a return to democratic processes in Venezuela and we have put significant sanctions on the Venezuelan leadership in order to urge them to allow democracy to return so that once again, Venezuela, a country that has tremendous capacity – oil and other natural resources – to be a successful, thriving, democratic nation that contributes to the world’s accumulated wealth, returns to a country of that nature.


QUESTION: Now very soon Brazil will be out of a period of political instability. They’ll have a new president. He is a man --


SECRETARY POMPEO: This weekend, yes.


QUESTION: Yeah, a man of the right. And then you have Colombia and Brazil with renewed political leadership. Do you think that between those two, and with help and inspiration from the United States, something can be done about the collapse of Venezuela? Because people are suffering in an extraordinary way there.


SECRETARY POMPEO: You mention Venezuela and Nicaragua together. I do think that the alignment of the new leaders in South America and Central America are determined to see these nations that are amongst their neighbors behaving in ways that are antithetical to the well-being of their own people give us the opportunity to change the course and direction of those two countries.


QUESTION: And a couple of last questions. Brexit. It just seems to me that the EU is being irrational here, Mr. Secretary, and may force – and I even fear a revival of the troubles in Northern Ireland if we’re not careful. Are you involved in trying to bring the UK and the EU together to a rational endpoint of this separation, this divorce?


SECRETARY POMPEO: This is a discussion between the EU and Britain. We are very hopeful they will continue to have conversations that will lead to an outcome that’s good for both entities.


QUESTION: And the last question goes to the United Nations. We’ve got a vacancy there and I’m sure you’ll find a right person, but I’ve never been a fan of having the ambassador in the cabinet. It has always seemed to me to be a mixed message about line of command. Has any decision been made about that?


SECRETARY POMPEO: No. That’ll be the President’s decision, both with respect to whether it will be a cabinet member and who it will be. Lots of work has been done in that regard and I’m confident that we’ll get a very good outcome, one that allows America to be represented in a fantastic way from the United Nations.


QUESTION: And you used to meet with the President daily, Mr. Secretary. Now you’re on the road a lot. How much time do you get to spend and talk with him about the world as it is and how it’s operating.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Quite a bit. I certainly don’t see him each day in the same way I did in my previous role, but I certainly talk to him every day and I’ll even be over there today in the middle of the day to spend about an hour with him talking about some of the issues that we discussed this morning.


QUESTION: Well I hope Iran is at the top of that list. Mr. Secretary, thanks for your time this morning and we look forward to having you back, and I hope that Tuesday next brings a vote of confidence in our China and Iran policy. Thank you, Mr. Secretary.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Thank you, Hugh. Bless you. So long.

SECRETARY POMPEO: Good afternoon, everyone. I want to start off by offering a somber commemoration. Thirty-five years ago today, a Hizballah terrorist, trained by the Iranian regime, drove a truck packed with explosives into the Marine barracks in Beirut, Lebanon, killing 241 Marines, sailors, and soldiers. We will never forget that cowardly act of terrorism or the heroes who came in peace and gave their lives that day.


	The President just spoke, as many of you know. I have five topics I want to address today that will add color to some of the things that the President said.


	First, we’re encouraged by the high voter turnout in the Afghan parliamentary elections this past weekend. We commend the Afghan security and defense forces in their efforts to facilitate credible elections. There were some technical issues, but despite that we remain committed to assisting the election commissions, especially in their work for the presidential election that will come in April of 2019.


	Second, the migrant caravan is violating Mexico’s sovereignty, laws, and immigration procedures. President Trump will not stand for this to happen to the United States. To those who say this is a hardhearted stance, let’s not forget that the United States is a historically generous nation when it comes to immigration.


	Over one million people per year are granted permanent legal status here in the United States. Over 33 million people total are currently here who have immigrated to this country legally. To those who want to come here: Come here legally. Legal immigration is the surest way to obtain the better life you are looking for here in the United States of America.


	From a security standpoint, there is no proper accounting of who these individuals in the caravan are, and this poses an unacceptable security risk to the United States. Moreover, many of these people are ripe targets for human traffickers and others who would exploit them. We don’t want that to happen.


	I’ve spoken twice in the last two days to my counterpart, Foreign Secretary Videgaray. We trust that Mexico’s leaders know what the best steps are to resolve this situation, and we urge timely action on their part. The United States also has a message for those who are currently part of this caravan or any caravan which follows: You will not be successful at getting into the United States illegally, no matter what. I repeat: The caravan will not cross our southern border illegally under any circumstances.


	If you seek to come here, go through the normal refugee process. If you apply for refugee status, a permanent solution is possible in Mexico or in a third country. But I can tell you with certainty we are determined that illegal entry into the United States from this caravan will not be possible.


	Third, the State Department will continue to seek all relevant facts, consult with Congress, and work with other nations, and work to hold accountable those responsible for the killing of Jamal Khashoggi. The administration is also taking appropriate actions now, given the information currently available to the United States.


	We have identified at least some of the individuals responsible, including those in the intelligence services, the Royal Court, the foreign ministry, and other Saudi ministries who we suspect to have been involved in Mr. Khashoggi’s death. We are taking appropriate actions, which include revoking visas, entering visa lookouts, and other measures. We are also working with the Treasury Department to review the applicability of Global Magnitsky sanctions to those individuals.


	These penalties will not be the last word on this matter from the United States. We will continue to explore additional measures to hold those responsible accountable. We’re making very clear that the United States does not tolerate this kind of ruthless action to silence Mr. Khashoggi, a journalist, through violence. We continue to maintain a strong partnership with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Neither the President nor I am happy with this situation.


	Our shared strategic interests with Saudi Arabia remain. We continue to view as achievable the twin imperatives of protecting America and holding accountable those responsible for the killing of Mr. Khashoggi.


	Fourth, last week, a delegation of Cuban diplomats threw a childish temper tantrum at a UN-sponsored gathering at the UN. It was a meeting highlighting the Cuban regime’s intolerance of political opposition and the plight of political prisoners. In response, I have written a letter to UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres requesting to know what measures the UN will take to respond to these actions and make sure that they do not happen again.


	And finally, it’s my honor to tell you that Ambassador Dan Smith will become the new director of the Foreign Service Institute, something which I intend to devote a significant piece of my time and attention to as the Secretary of State. This is a very important institution here for our Foreign Service officers. Dan will lead the State Department institution responsible for all of our team’s initial training and their continued professional development. Dan shares my vision – I knew him when he was head of INR and I was in my previous role. Dan shares my vision of having the best-trained and most professional diplomatic corps in the world. He is impeccably qualified for this role, and I look forward to him taking the helm at FSI.


	I’m now happy to take a few questions.


MS NAUERT: Okay. We just have a few minutes for questions today. We’re running late for another meeting. Our apologies. Matt, we’ll start with you.


QUESTION: Thanks, Heather. Thanks, Mr. Secretary.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Hi there, sir.


QUESTION: The President, as – I don’t know if you could add color to the President’s comments. He just called the – what the Saudi operation or the attempt to conceal the worst cover-up in the history of cover-ups. And I’m wondering, one, if you agree with that characterization; and then second, if you could be a little bit more specific about the actions that you’re taking with regard to the visa revocations. How many, roughly, are we talking about, people here?


	And then on the migrants, what will you say to people who say – who would criticize your comments just now as being a bit disingenuous by telling them to apply for refugee status when this administration has slashed the number of refugee – the number of refugees it will admit?


SECRETARY POMPEO: I said I’d take a few questions. You just asked three. I assume everyone in the room would be very disappointed in you for having taken all the questions.


QUESTION: I hope not.


SECRETARY POMPEO: So let me take the last one first. This is a nation that is historically generous with respect to accepting refugees and persons from all around the world. There is no mistaking that; it will continue to be so. And so those who want to come here legally have every means available to do that. People can also file to be refugees in other countries other than the United States of America. And so what we know is this: We’re a nation built on laws. We have an obligation – the President has an obligation – to protect American sovereignty and to secure our borders. To make sure that we know who’s coming in and out of country is not only appropriate, but it is a duty of the United States government. We’ll continue to make sure that we execute that with great energy and vigor and professionalism.


	Second, I’ll get you the numbers. We have them, but I want to make sure I get them to you right. I’ll make sure everybody gets a chance to see the numbers. There’s not a lot more that I can say about – other than to say that this is certainly not the last step that we will take, that we will continue to do our own efforts, our own fact finding, to make sure the decision that the United States makes are based on real facts and real data that we can confirm ourselves. We’ll certainly take information that comes from other sources, the Turkish intelligence services, the Saudis.


	We will evaluate that information, validate that information, and form our own judgments about the facts and then hold those responsible accountable based on the facts that we determine are appropriate.


	We will work with Congress. I’ve spoken to our allies around the world. We want to make sure that everyone understands that the United States doesn’t believe that the killing of Jamal Khashoggi was anything other than a horrific act. And we hope that we can work together, both with Congress and our allies, to hold those responsible accountable.


MS NAUERT: Let’s go to Nazira. Nazira’s from Afghanistan.


QUESTION: Thank you very much, Heather. Mr. Secretary, thank you very much to talk about Afghanistan election. It was really unique. Thanks. We are very happy for that, but unfortunately, Pakistan still do something wrong. As you know, incident that General Raziq has been killed. Some reports said Pakistan was behind of that action. Do you think that if Pakistan doesn’t change their policy, what will be the next action of United States to Pakistan to change their policy toward Afghanistan?


SECRETARY POMPEO: So I had a chance to travel and meet the new leader of Pakistan not too many weeks ago now. We had made clear that the U.S. policy with respect to South Central Asia has not changed, that our expectation is that Pakistan will not provide safe harbor to terrorists on their western border – we couldn’t have made that message any more clear – and that Pakistan will be held to account if they don’t achieve that, if they’re not sincere in that effort.


	We don’t believe we can get to the place that everyone wants, right. Everyone wants a reconciliation in Afghanistan, and to achieve that, you can’t have a safe harbor for Taliban, for Haqqani, and for others inside of Pakistan. The Pakistani government knows that that’s our view and this administration has already made significant efforts to hold them accountable, and we hope that they’ll achieve the goal that we’ve set out for them.


MS NAUERT: Reuters.


QUESTION: Thank you very much. Mr. Secretary, thank you very much. Given the President’s comment about the “worst cover-up ever,” does the Trump administration still have trust and confidence in Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman as a reliable security partner of the United States, or is there a belief that he might have been part of the cover-up and should temporarily step aside until it can be independently established whether he’d played a role of any kind in the killing of Mr. Khashoggi?


SECRETARY POMPEO: We’re learning the facts and as facts unfold, as we continue to develop our understanding of the individuals that were responsible for this, who not only executed it but led and were involved and were connected to it, the world should know that we intend to hold those individuals accountable when we develop that fact set. And we – literally, we hope to continue to learn facts. We’ve learned a lot over the last few days. We hope to learn a lot in the next 48 and 72 hours as well, a great deal more in the next 48 or 72 hours as well.


MS NAUERT: Last question, Andrea.


QUESTION: Mr. Secretary --


SECRETARY POMPEO: Yes, ma’am.


QUESTION: -- following up – thank you. President Erdogan said today that this was a savage and premeditated murder. You say you’re learning the facts. The President says it’s the worst cover-up. The Saudis are now telling us that this was an attempt to hold Khashoggi in a Turkish safe house for two days. Do you accept that explanation? You personally were told one story and it has evolved over the days. So do you think that the Saudis are still covering this up, and do you feel misled by them? You said you’re not happy, the President is not happy. Do you feel personally misled by the crown prince and do you accept what President Erdogan has said today?


SECRETARY POMPEO: So I don’t think I’ve said what it is the crown prince told me. I don’t talk about those discussions, and still do not --


QUESTION: I’m just asking whether you accept what he said to you?


SECRETARY POMPEO: -- and still do not intend to. We’re going to accept what America learns. We’re going to accept the data set that we’re able to develop. We’ve got people working all across the world to figure out what we can know, what’s knowable, to figure out which facts we can determine to put our own understanding together. Because things like – I talked about the work that we’ve asked Treasury to help the State Department with on Global Magnitsky. That’s got to be our work. We have to develop our own data set on which we have reliable evidence in order to base such a judgment to find someone as having violated U.S. law.


	So it will be our work to do. We will – as always in my former role, all sorts of intelligence, so we’ll take in all the data set but we will validate it, we will verify it, we will learn the facts for ourselves, and then we’ll --


QUESTION: Has Turkey cooperated? Are they giving you what you need to know?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Yeah, the Turks have been very cooperative with us and the Turks have told us that the Saudis have cooperated with them as well.


QUESTION: Has any U.S. official heard an audio tape or seen evidence from the Turks?


SECRETARY POMPEO: I don’t have – I don’t have anything more to share with you about particular data sets. As we do, I assure you we will continue to keep you informed. As we learn, we will share those facts. And more importantly, you will see the United States hold the persons that we believe should be held accountable – hold them accountable. You can rest assured that President Trump is committed to that.


	I’ll take one more, Heather.


QUESTION: (Off-mike)


SECRETARY POMPEO: One more. What do you got?


QUESTION: So the Senate and the House, they signed a new bill called HIFPA now, too.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Mm-hmm.


QUESTION: So it’s now on the desk of the President. Is the administration expected to sign this bill soon, or before the midterm election or after?


SECRETARY POMPEO: I don’t know the timing on when the President intends to sign that.


QUESTION: (Off-mike)


MS NAUERT: Okay. Thank you, everybody. The Secretary has to go; he’s late for a meeting.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Great. Thank you all. Have a good afternoon.


QUESTION: Thank you.

"October 21, 2018","
	The United States is closely following the migrant caravan, in which thousands of migrants from Honduras and other countries continue to make a dangerous journey through Guatemala and into Mexico. Many migrants are attempting to transit these countries and in the process are violating their sovereignty, their laws, and their procedures. As President Trump has stated, consistent with U.S. law, the United States will not allow illegal immigrants to enter or remain in the United States.


	We are concerned that these migrants may be victimized by human smugglers or others who would exploit them. We also are deeply concerned by the violence provoked by some members of the group, as well as the apparent political motivation of some organizers of the caravan.


	We understand Mexico will detain and repatriate migrants who enter Mexico in violation of Mexican law, and in instances where migrants apply for asylum, process the requests in accordance with Mexican law. We also understand that those who do not qualify will be returned in a safe and orderly process, consistent with Mexican law.


	We welcome the Government of Mexico's collaboration with the United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) to address refugee and migration issues in the region, including the influx of people arriving in Mexico. The United States stands ready to assist the Government of Mexico in this effort.

",Migrant Caravan,http://www.state.gov/secretary/remarks/2018/10/286805.htm
"October 19, 2018","
QUESTION: Mr. Secretary, nice to see you, sir.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Greta, it’s great to be with you.


QUESTION: This is your second trip to Mexico, but why are you here now in Mexico?


SECRETARY POMPEO: So as the new government makes this transition beginning on December 1st, we’re working diligently to make sure we have a solid foreign policy relationship with them. So we certainly are working with the existing government. I’ll see President Pena Nieto in just a few minutes, was with Foreign Secretary Videgaray this morning, but also working with my new counterpart, Marcelo Ebrard, to make sure that the United States and Mexico are coordinated across a broad array of issues – security, trade, and of course migration as well.


QUESTION: All right, with trade the United States just negotiated a new deal with Mexico and Canada. Let me turn to the issue of the migration – the caravan that is coming up from Guatemala headed to Mexico and then presumably, maybe, someplace else, maybe the United States. What does Mexico say about that?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Mexico agrees that it’s not constructive to have unlawful migration transit from these Northern Triangle countries through Mexico into the United States, and so part of my mission here today is to coordinate with them in a way that takes these folks, who are often victims – coyotes taking money from these people to transit them through a very difficult transit – kids, children, who are put in really bad places – to work with the Mexican Government to accomplish President Trump’s mission, which is to make sure that we have American sovereignty and a secure border.


QUESTION: What is Mexico’s strategy to stop the caravan?


SECRETARY POMPEO: So we’re working with the current government. It’s their strategy, and we recognize Mexican sovereignty, their right to make the decisions the way they want. Just yesterday they spoke with the UN, and so they’re going to use all the resources at their disposal to make sure that they treat these people with the dignity and respect that they deserve, but at the same time create a situation where they understand that it is not fruitful to transit through Mexico into the United States. There are multiple components to this, and we work with the incoming government too to make sure this is a sustainable model once we achieve our goal.


QUESTION: I imagine one of the things we have to worry about, the root reason why they’re migrating. What is being done by either by the United States or Mexico, if anything, to sort of deal with the root reason why they’re leaving their home countries?


SECRETARY POMPEO: So the new Mexican Government has a vision for how they will work to create jobs and wealth in the southern part of their country, and we all have a mission to try and create opportunity in Honduras and El Salvador and Guatemala, in the Northern Triangle countries as well. Most all of these people are leaving because of economic opportunity; they just don’t have any. And we need to do our best to create an environment where they don’t need to transit not only to the United States but to Mexico or anyplace else.


QUESTION: President Trump has said, and I’m sure – I mean, I suspect the Mexican authorities brought it up with you – is that if they come up to the United States is that two things: One is he’ll close the border and consider sending military to the border. Did they bring that up with you?


SECRETARY POMPEO: We talked about a whole wide range of alternatives, alternatives that the Mexican Government could take, that the Northern Triangle countries could take, and certainly ones that the United States can take. We are optimistic. We are watching what’s taking place with these caravans – which, by the way, are not organic, are being created by outside forces and supported by them – and working diligently to make sure that these people understand that it is not in their best interest to try and make this trip up to the United States southern border.


QUESTION: Who are the outside forces? What groups?


SECRETARY POMPEO: There are political opponents of the Honduran leadership that are underwriting this. If you take a look at what’s going on down there, this is not just a group of people who happen to have wandered together into a big group.


QUESTION: Before you came to Mexico, you were in Panama. Why did you stop in Panama?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Longtime partner of the United States on security, on counternarcotics. I’ve known President Varela for some time and wanted to go back to talk to them about several issues where there’s more work to be done between our two countries, including some concerns we have about Chinese investment throughout Central America and Panama and in South America, and make sure that we understood each other with respect to the wide range of issues where Panama and the United States work together. We have important economic relationships with them as well, and I wanted to make sure he understood we welcome investment from them and we were looking to build U.S. investment in his country as well.


QUESTION: Are you suspicious of the motive of the Chinese investment in Panama?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Yes.


QUESTION: In what way?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Look, we’ve watched this all around the world. Panama is fortunate; they’re a sophisticated country with a real economy and a growing GDP, so they’re in a pretty good place relative to some other countries. But we watched Chinese predatory activity in countries around the world, where they show up with a bunch of money and then put strings on it, which put the people of that country in a terrible position two, and five, and ten years down the road.


	And we think it’s very important that if the Chinese want to invest that’s great, but it needs to be done in a way that is transparent and open and in the best interests of the people of the country in which they’re investing, and not tethered to some constraint that the Chinese would place on that country in the event that country is unable to repay the debts that they are incurring.


QUESTION: So how do you convince Panama to turn down Chinese money? Does the United States have to sort of step up to the plate and do its own investment?


SECRETARY POMPEO: A country like Panama is pretty straightforward. They want to be part of Western society, right? They want to do things by the book, by the rule of law, without corruption. They want to engage in activity that is beneficial to their own people and have the economic capacity to do so. They’re not in a position where the poverty in their country drives them to have to take money even under onerous conditions.


	And so you just talk about how you can help make sure that America will be there to provide alternatives, and that other Western countries will be there too to make sure they understand that it’s in their people’s best interest to engage in commercial activity that truly, over the long haul, benefits their own people.


QUESTION: Well, it certainly seems like China is getting a bigger footprint there, especially in light of the fact that about a year ago Panama recognized China and not Taiwan. It seems that China certainly is moving into that area.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Yeah, China is intent on that. And again, we don’t have any problem with Chinese commercial investment. That’s their right to go compete in the world. I am convinced that if we compete with them all over the world, we’ll do incredibly well. But what we can’t accept and what we need to make sure every country understands is that when they show up and it looks too good to be true, it almost certainly is.


QUESTION: And have you brought that up with China, about their trading in the Western – about them operating in Panama?


SECRETARY POMPEO: I don’t know that I’ve brought up Panama in particular, but I’ve certainly brought up what we view as commercial practices with their state-owned enterprises that are inconsistent with good behavior around the world.


QUESTION: Venezuela was – is also an issue in this hemisphere. It’s a failed state. President Maduro – it doesn’t look like it’s getting any better. What is – what’s the U.S. strategy, if any, with Venezuela?


SECRETARY POMPEO: We’ve been very consistent. We have urged the people of Venezuela to restore democracy to their own country, and you’ve seen the sanctions that we put in place, not only against the country, which sometimes have an adverse impact on the people of Venezuela, but also against the Venezuelan leadership, those people who are oppressing their own citizens. And another reason for my visit to this part of the world is to urge the countries of the OAS and of the region to ensure that we have a coordinated set of policies, a common understanding, and frankly, the Lima Group and other organizations have done really good work to put pressure on the Maduro regime and to try and create opportunity for those in Venezuela who want the restoration of democracy. This is a nation with enormous economic capacity, the ability to have real wealth, and what they need to do that is the rule of law and democracy, and we are continuing to work with the Venezuelan people to assist them in achieving that.


QUESTION: Coincidentally, I was at the border of Venezuela; I was in Colombia a few days ago and it looked pretty bleak. People were parading over the border to --


SECRETARY POMPEO: It’s tough, lots of migration there as well.


QUESTION: And with no hope. I mean, they tell me stories about how the whole – the industry has collapsed to the extent that it hasn’t been – it’s all been nationalized, but they don’t have groceries on the shelves. It’s just getting worse there, and Cuba’s moved in there.


SECRETARY POMPEO: We are searching for a solution which will deliver democracy to Venezuela, and then it can go back to being a country with the things that you described, simple accommodations for their people. It’s the Maduro regime that has inflicted this set of horrible living conditions on the people of Venezuela, and it will ultimately be the people of Venezuela that fix it.


QUESTION: Can, will the U.S., or do you anticipate the U.S. will increase sanctions in Venezuela?


SECRETARY POMPEO: I’ve been pretty consistent at our pattern of identifying sanctions that we think will deliver on that democratic outcome, and so I – while I don’t want to tell you what we’ll do tomorrow, I’m confident we will find other places where we think we can exert pressure in a way that will convince Maduro that this isn’t going to work, that he’s not going to get to retain power forever, and that oppressing his people in the way that you’ve just described is inhumane and inappropriate and not what real leaders do. And so we’re hoping this transition led by the Venezuelan people will take place, and I’m confident that we will find other places where sanctions will be appropriate.


QUESTION: You used the term “transition.” Is that sort of a – is that a word for a coup? I mean, do you expect Maduro not to be in power?


SECRETARY POMPEO: I expect the Venezuelan people to restore democracy to their country. If they happen to choose Maduro, well, the Venezuelan people get to choose. I – as you’ve described the horrors that Maduro has inflicted on his people, that seems unlikely to me.


QUESTION: Have you followed the litigation with Citgo, which is 90 percent of the income to the government of Venezuela is from their oil from Citgo, and now there’s a question of who’s – what’s going to happen with Citgo, which will only add increased financial pressure on Venezuela. Are you following that at all?


SECRETARY POMPEO: I am. It’s a very complicated issue, but we are – Treasury and State Department are both following this very, very closely, and we’re constantly re-evaluating our approach to all of the economic issues surrounding Venezuela.


QUESTION: All right. This is not your first trip this week. You were also over in the Middle East. You were in Saudi Arabia and Turkey. How do you describe currently the importance – the U.S. – the importance of Saudi Arabia to the United States?


SECRETARY POMPEO: They have been a strategic ally of ours since the early 1930s and recently have been even more important. They have assisted us in pushing back against the world’s largest state sponsor of terror, the Islamic Republic of Iran. They’ve been a great counterterrorism partner during our administration. We have economic ties with them that are deep and important. A broad spectrum of strategic relationships between the United States and Saudi Arabia.


QUESTION: If the investigation turns out – and the investigation is ongoing – that the crown prince or the king had deeper involvement that’s being suspected or people are saying in the media, that it’s determined to be that, what can the United States do or what should it do in light of the fact of its strategic importance?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Well, the President has said that it – there’ll have to be some response in the event that the facts turn out the way that you hypothesized that they will turn out. I’m not going to get into what those responses might be. We’ll certainly consider a wide range of potential responses. But I think the important thing to do is that the facts come out. When I traveled to Saudi Arabia I met with the king, I met with the crown prince at great length, I met with Foreign Minister Jubeir, and I made very clear to them that the United States takes this matter very seriously, that we don’t approve of extrajudicial killings, that we don’t approve of that kind of activity, that it is – it’s not something consistent with American values, and that it is their responsibility – as this incident happened in their consulate, it is their responsibility to get to the bottom of this, to put the facts out clearly, accurately, completely, transparently, in a way that the whole world could see, and once we have identified the fact set, then they have the responsibility in the first instance to hold accountable those inside their country that may have been involved in any wrongdoing.


QUESTION: All right. Turkey has been at odds with Saudi Arabia. This certainly has put them at greater odds in light of what’s happened. What’s the strategic importance of Turkey to the United States?


SECRETARY POMPEO: So my second stop this week was in Ankara. I met with President Erdogan and my counterpart, Mevlut Cavusoglu. We have deep relationships. They’re a NATO ally. We have had challenges with them. They had held Pastor Brunson; they still continue to detain three locally employed people who were at our embassy there. So there are still many challenges in this relationship. But they sit at an incredibly important place and they always will – the bridge between Europe and the Middle East. And as a member of NATO, we need to work to continue to improve that relationship so that we can work together to achieve the ends of NATO and ends – in places where Turkey and the United States have overlapping interests, including the challenges that are in Syria today. I think there are real places where we can work with Turkey in Syria to get better outcomes for the Syrian people.


QUESTION: It’s incredibly complicated, isn’t it?


SECRETARY POMPEO: It is. It is complicated.


QUESTION: Indeed, complicated. All right, North Korea. You were recently over in that region and it was announced that some military exercises with South Korea are going to be postponed, the ones that were scheduled for December. Do you anticipate a meeting between Kim Jong-un and President Trump in the very near future?


SECRETARY POMPEO: I do.


QUESTION: How do you define very near future?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Yeah, I – (laughter) – so I’m not prepared to tell you when it’s going to be as the date has not yet been set. But the President is committed to doing that. We’re working on finding dates and times and places that will work for each of the two leaders. I’m very hopeful we’ll have senior leader meetings here in the next week and a half or so between myself and my counterpart to continue this discussion so that when the two of them get together there is real opportunity to make another big step forward on denuclearization. Chairman Kim reiterated when I was with him now I guess it’s two weeks ago, his commitment to that – that he stands by the commitment he made to President Trump in Singapore on June 12th, and we intend to do everything we can to make sure that he delivers on that so that we can come to the day where the people of North Korea will indeed have a brighter future. President Trump is determined to have North Korea achieve that.


QUESTION: What surprised you the most about the negotiations with Kim Jong-un?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Goodness, I’m not sure much has surprised me in the sense of, this is very difficult. For decades, North Korea has depended on their nuclear arsenal or the promise thereof as their lynchpin for their security. And so to make that transition, to make the strategic decision that Chairman Kim tells us he has made that says we no longer need our nuclear arsenal for our country to be successful, is a very difficult challenge for a North Korean leader. I’m very happy that he’s made this decision, but to execute on that is complex and will take time. And so long as we can continue to make process – progress and not have missiles being fired and nuclear tests being conducted, allowing them to prefect their program even further, then I think it’s all to the good.


QUESTION: One last question: What’s a better job? Director of the CIA or Secretary of State?


SECRETARY POMPEO: It’s the only question I’m not going to answer, Greta. They are both great jobs and --


QUESTION: Wait, which one do you get more sleep with?


SECRETARY POMPEO: It’s an incredible privilege to have the chance to do each of those two.


QUESTION: Which do you get more sleep with?


SECRETARY POMPEO: I think I got a little more sleep in the previous one.


QUESTION: All right. Thank you, Mr. Secretary.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Thank you, Greta.

	The United States reiterates its strong support for religious freedom and the freedom of members of religious groups, including Ukraine’s Orthodox community, to govern their religion according to their beliefs, free of outside interference.


	We support Ukrainians’ ability to worship as they choose and hope this will be respected by all. Tolerance, restraint, and understanding are key to ensuring that people with different religious affiliations can live and prosper together in peace. We urge Church and government officials to actively promote these values in connection with the move towards the establishment of an autocephalous Ukrainian Orthodox Church.

SECRETARY POMPEO: I just wanted to give you a little bit of a readout on my meeting with President Pena Nieto. It was a good conversation. We are jointly very focused on the caravan that is making its way through. The Mexican Government is making all the decisions about how to address this, and they are fully engaged. They sent 500 federales down to the southern border.


	I want to express my sympathy to them. They’ve had four policemen injured already, as they have reported it. We understand that to be accurate. We don’t know the severity of those injuries, but I want to express my sympathy to those four policemen. That’s evidence of what this really is. This is a group, a large group of people; they are putting women and children in front of the caravan to use as shields as they make their way through. This is an organized effort to come through and violate the sovereignty of Mexico, and so we’re prepared to do all that we can to support the decisions that Mexico makes about how they’re going to address this very serious and important issue to their country.


	So it was a good discussion. We talked about a handful of other things as well, but I wanted to make sure I shared with you all the commitment of the Mexican Government to address this in a serious way. So thank you all very much.

FOREIGN SECRETARY VIDEGARAY: (Via interpreter) Good morning to the representatives of the media. Welcome to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.


	It’s my privilege to welcome back to the – to our building and our city the Secretary of State of the United States Government, Mike Pompeo. Welcome back, Mike. It’s a pleasure to have you here, and you and your team. And now I will switch to Spanish.


	(Via interpreter) For the Government of Mexico, it has always been a pleasure and an opportunity to welcome the Secretary of State of the United States at home. In – at least six times, Secretary Pompeo has visited our country in two occasions. And this is a notable change with respect to what was happening in the past, when we were used to the Secretary of State of the United States would visit the Middle East eight or ten times before coming to Mexico. This is a sample of the interest, importance that Secretary Pompeo has given to the relationship with Mexico, and this is something that we are very grateful for. It is – this is an opportunity to work together for the welfare of our people.


	So thank you very much, Mr. Secretary, for your interest that you have shown in this – the relations between our countries as well as your leadership that you have taken on to build a better relation. The relationship between Mexico and the United States is large, it’s important, and it is also a complex relation. We have the most-traveled borders in the world. We have trade for a million dollars per minute. The border is crossed by more than a million people every day, and for Mexico and the United States this is the source of direct foreign investment and also a destination of our exports. In trade and investment and in migration and security, there is no other relationship that has the scope and transcendence that the relationship has with the United States.


	With the government of President Trump, we have worked since day one with a logic of mutual respect to achieve understanding, and there are some differences that are yet important with the administration of President Trump, but something that is a merit of both administrations that we have – we haven’t allowed those differences to define our relations and we have been able to work together not only respectfully but also effectively. And I believe that there has been a significant achieved, which is the agreement in commercial – USMCA, which undoubtedly will provide not only stability and certainty to the economy of the United States and Mexico and Canada, but that will also be an opportunity for our region to be the most competitive in the world. And what this is about is that this example has yielded concrete results and that will be repeated in the rest of our relationship. We are dealing transcendental challenges. There are significant challenges and urgent things.


	Part of our work meeting, we have talked about the caravan that – meaning that a group of Honduran citizens have tried to come to the – to Mexico with the purpose of reaching the United States. This is a challenge that Mexico is dealing with and I have expressed it so to Secretary Pompeo. We are a sovereign country. The migratory policy of Mexico is defined by Mexico, just as the migratory policy of the United States is defined by the United States. We are friend countries, we are partners, we are neighbors, and we are sovereign countries.


	About this caravan, I would like to tell you that Secretary Pompeo’s commented that what is the essence of our position? It is the respect to human rights, the dignity of people, as well as the protection of this migrant group, particularly those that are most vulnerable, which are the children, the older citizens, and the women who are pregnant and are part of this caravan. Of course, in Mexico we have the rule of law, and we shall apply – enforce the law, but there will also be a humanitarian way that we will think about the migrant in the first place. That is why we have talked with Secretary Pompeo, that yesterday Mexico has invited the United Nations to the – at the office of the high commission, ACNUR, to involve – to get – to ask for the involvement in the process to help the migratory authorities of Mexico to rule on each of the individual requests that have been filed. Further on, we will work according to the Cartagena Protocol in order to find a permanent solution for the migrants.


	We have been very close to the group that is – that are part of the caravan. The ambassador and the authorities, we have been in constant communication with the members of the caravan and explained them what are the options that they will find when they reach the border with Mexico. And we will encourage them so that their access to Mexico will be according to the – our laws and according to the procedures that we have set forth so that they can have a better life in view of the difficult circumstances they are experiencing in their country.


	Something that we agree fully with the government of President Trump and Secretary Pompeo is the need to serve the root causes of the Central American migration, particularly to create development opportunities. We talked largely in our conversation that we had in Washington last week, where we had representatives of the three countries – Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras – and this will continue to be very important element of the international cooperation for development. For Mexico, it will be important to work with the United States so that we can create greater opportunities of development, employment, and welfare for the Central American populations, which indeed is the only option and solution to the problem that – of migration.


	I am sure that the relationship between Mexico and the United States will go very well, and from the – with the transition from one administration to another. We welcome that President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador and President Trump have already had talks and they – and Secretary Pompeo would meet with President-elect Lopez Obrador as well as Marcelo Ebrard, who will be the foreign minister. I know that these talks will set the basis for a good understanding between Mexico and United States. This is advisable for United States and for the Mexicans, and we welcome the existence of this path of approach and friendship, always with a respect to the sovereignty of both countries, who understand that sovereignty and opportunities for joint wellness of prosperity and harmony. Thank you very much, Secretary Pompeo. It’s an honor to welcome you to this, which is ‘your house,’ as the Mexican’s say.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Gracias.


MODERATOR: Thank you, Secretary. Next, we will give the floor to the Secretary of State of the United States, Michael Pompeo.


SECRETARY POMPEO: First of all, thank you, Foreign Secretary Videgaray, for hosting me today. I appreciate it. I also want to thank President Pena Nieto and President-elect Lopez Obrador, and my incoming counterpart Foreign Secretary Ebrard for their shared commitment to tackling the challenges between our two countries.


	I want to take just one moment to say thank you to you, Luis. Your dedication to vigorously defending the interests and rights of the Mexican people at every opportunity, every time I’ve met and encountered you, has been noble and proper, and you have done it with an enormous amount of professionalism. It’s probably the last time you and I will have a chance to be here together, and I wanted the Mexican people to know how well you have represented them. You’ve been vigorous. You have fought us hard, but always with the shared interest of making sure that our two countries ended up in a better place together, and I want to give my personal appreciation and thank you to you, Luis, for having done that.


FOREIGN SECRETARY VIDEGARAY: Gracias.


SECRETARY OF STATE POMPEO: As you said, it’s true, we still have serious issues and challenges between us. We’re at a moment today, too, but I’m confident that our ability to tackle these issues together will lead us towards the right path. You don’t have to guess about that. We saw that with the trade agreement that our two countries put together. And I thank you and your entire government for the work that you put in to what was a vigorous debate, a hard-fought set of discussions, but got us to an outcome that I think will benefit each of our two countries for years and years and years to come. We’ll grow jobs. We’ll create wealth for the citizens of each of our two countries. And as President Trump has said, it is truly a good deal for all of us and for everyone, the Mexican people and the American people and the Canadian people as well.


	Look, President Trump’s been clear about the largest issue that we face today after having negotiated that deal. We are quickly reaching a point which appears to be a moment of crisis, record numbers of migrants. Foreign Secretary Videgaray and I spoke about the importance of stopping this flow before it reaches the U.S. border. We are deeply aware that the way that Mexico will handle this, the way you will handle this is your sovereign decision. Mexico will make its decision. Its leaders and its people will decide the best way to achieve what I believe are our shared objectives, and I thank you for all the effort that you have put into this over the last few days, including your request for humanitarian assistance to the United Nations to address this migrant caravan.


	I’ll speak with this with President Nieto as well, as well as with incoming Secretary Ebrard. The challenge related to securing our southern border is also a challenge for American sovereignty. We’ve got to fix U.S. laws in order to handle this properly as well. That is an American burden, a uniquely American burden, and as President Trump has said, it’s something that we need to address inside of our country to make sure that we do this well. If we get it right, we will improve the relationship between our two countries materially as well.


	We also had a chance to talk a bit about how we can expand on the progress we’ve made at advancing security and prosperity throughout the Northern Triangle countries. We talked about this last week in Washington at the conference. We know that promoting economic growth and increasing security there is a critical component of solving the set of immigration issues we face. We have to all keep in context that this problem has enormous implications for the opioid epidemic in the United States, which President Trump has declared a national emergency. His fight against it has both a domestic and international component, and I have expressed and will express today America’s starting to deepen the cooperation with Mexico to address the production, distribution, markets in illicit revenue of transnational criminal organizations that traffic drugs into the United States.


	I also want to thank you and President Pena Nieto for our continued collaboration with you to defend democracy and human rights in places like Venezuela and Nicaragua. We appreciate the leadership Mexico’s shown in this regard in the OAS and elsewhere.


	Look, the bottom line is this: We have tremendous opportunity between our two countries. We have many challenges. But as we have just proven with our trade agreement, we can, with mutual respect for the sovereignty and rights of each of our two nations, tackle these problems, and I’m confident that we will resolve them together.


	Thank you, Foreign Secretary Videgaray.

We also extend hope for the speedy recovery of all those injured in the attack, including two Americans and one Coalition member who were present at the time.


	The United States is resolved to continue its support for the Government and people of Afghanistan as they work to provide security for all Afghan citizens, including for the upcoming parliamentary elections on October 20. Recent attacks against parliamentary candidates in the final days of campaigning in Afghanistan stand in stark contrast to the aspirations of the Afghan people for peace, security, and economic stability. The right and desire of the Afghan people for their votes to be counted must be respected.

QUESTION: (In Spanish)


	Welcome to this interview.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Thank you.


QUESTION: Mr. Secretary, what is the purpose of this sudden visit to Panama?


SECRETARY POMPEO: So I came here to do a couple things. First, to thank the Panamanian people for being such good partners with the United States for so many years, also to meet with President Varela to talk about the important strategic issues in which our two countries are engaged. I was hoping to get here in time to see the Comfort, but I missed it by a few hours. It was doing such good work for the region helping take good medical care of so many people. But I wanted to get here. We have important issues in front of us in the region and for Panama, and I wanted to get here to see President Varela to discuss them with him.


QUESTION: You just met with President Varela and Vice President Saint Malo. Can you speak about the scope of the conversation?


SECRETARY POMPEO: We talked about many things. We talked about the great work we do together on security issues. We talked about investment between our two countries. We spoke about some regional issues as well, the challenges in Venezuela and Nicaragua, and many more topics too. I’ve known President Varela for a while, and it was great to catch up with him on such a broad range of subjects.


QUESTION: Last month the State Department called Charge Cabral for consultations along with the ambassadors of El Salvador and the Dominican Republic. The main issue discussed was China’s growing influence in the region. Do you have any message you wish to deliver in this regard?


SECRETARY POMPEO: So America wants good things for the people of Panama and for the region, and so we want to make sure when there are countries that invest, China included, that they’re done in a way that is consistent with international law and they’re good for the Panamanian people. And we’ve seen times when that was the case, but other times where China has not behaved that way. And so we very much want good things for the country and want to make sure that everybody has eyes wide open when it comes to China’s investments in their country and in this region.


QUESTION: How would you characterize the state of U.S.-Panama relations at this time?


SECRETARY POMPEO: They’re really good. We do fantastic work together. The counternarcotics work that our two countries do together is important. It’s important to the United States, but it’s important to Panama and the region as well. We work so closely on so many issues that are of importance to the people of the United States and of Panama. I have to say our relationship is in fantastic shape, and I hope, as a result of today, just a little bit better as well.


QUESTION: Besides the crisis in Nicaragua and Venezuela mentioned in the press statement, are there any additional issues you wish to bring to the fore?


SECRETARY POMPEO: I always think the recognition of how closely we are tied together, the United States, Central America, Panama, South America. We are one region. There’s so much good that we can do when we work together. We can build our economies, create jobs and wealth in both of our countries and in all – all across the region. If there was one message, it would be our continued economic cooperation in ways that benefit each of our two countries.


QUESTION: You just mentioned that to negotiate with China you have to have the eyes wide open. Can you elaborate more about that?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Well, it’s simply the case that in parts of the world China has invested in ways that have left countries worse off, and that should never be the case. Anytime there is investment that comes from outside of a country, it certainly should be a good investment for the investor, but it has to be something that’s good for the country that hosts that investment and well – as well. And we just want to make sure that when China invests, wherever it chooses, that it does so in a way that benefits the people of the country in which that investment is made.


QUESTION: Thank you. And do you anticipate any changes in the future relations between our countries?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Nothing particularly concrete. We’re in such a good place today. I hope we can continue to benefit from the goodwill of the Panamanian people; and in exactly the reverse way, I hope that Panama can continue to benefit from the goodwill of the American people as well.


QUESTION: Thank you.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Thank you very much.


QUESTION: Thank you very much for this opportunity.


SECRETARY POMPEO: It’s wonderful to be with you, Sabrina. Thank you.

	I am pleased to announce that following the May 14 opening of the U.S. Embassy to Israel in Jerusalem, we plan to achieve significant efficiencies and increase our effectiveness by merging U.S. Embassy Jerusalem and U.S. Consulate General Jerusalem into a single diplomatic mission. I have asked our Ambassador to Israel, David Friedman, to guide the merger.


	We will continue to conduct a full range of reporting, outreach, and programming in the West Bank and Gaza as well as with Palestinians in Jerusalem through a new Palestinian Affairs Unit inside U.S. Embassy Jerusalem. That unit will operate from our Agron Road site in Jerusalem.


	This decision is driven by our global efforts to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of our operations. It does not signal a change of U.S. policy on Jerusalem, the West Bank, or the Gaza Strip. As the President proclaimed in December of last year, the United States continues to take no position on final status issues, including boundaries or borders. The specific boundaries of Israeli sovereignty in Jerusalem are subject to final status negotiations between the parties.


	The Administration is strongly committed to achieving a lasting and comprehensive peace that offers a brighter future to Israel and the Palestinians. We look forward to continued partnership and dialogue with the Palestinian people and, we hope in the future, with the Palestinian leadership.

SECRETARY POMPEO: So I’d had on my list to go see President Varela for a while. It took me six months to get here. They have been an important partner of ours for a long time. I knew President Varela from my previous role as well. Economic ties, security ties, counternarcotics, all a lynchpin of our efforts in Central and South America. And so it was important, although we were just on the ground for a little bit, to get there to thank him for the work they’re doing and to remind them, and we had the chance to talk to some local media and remind the entire region, that when China comes calling it’s not always to the good of your citizens, and when they show up with a straight-up, legitimate investment that’s transparent and according to the rule of law, that’s called competition and it’s something that the United States welcomes, but when they show up with deals that seem to be too good to be true it’s often the case that they, in fact, are. So we had a good conversation about that as well.


QUESTION: Just the latest news, if you don’t mind, Secretary. The ABC is reporting that a Turkish official says he showed you a transcript of the tape, the purported tape, and that they played you the audio. Can you respond to that?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Yeah, we asked you to ask questions about Panama. Do you have a question about Panama?


QUESTION: I have a question about Mexico. It’s also been --


SECRETARY POMPEO: Happy to take your question about Mexico.


QUESTION: It’s also been reported that there’s been an agreement between Mexico and Guatemala, I think, on the border issue with the caravan coming up from Honduras. Do you have anything to say about that?


SECRETARY POMPEO: So we’re working on it. I just had a chance to speak with Foreign Secretary Videgaray about his work today at the United Nations. There’s still a fair amount of work. One of the things we hope to accomplish both with the existing government – I’ll get a chance to speak to the incoming foreign secretary, Marcelo Ebrard, here in just a little bit, if we can get everybody’s phone working right, so that we can do the good work we need to make sure that we have legal entrants and only legal entrants crossing our border.


QUESTION: Are there specific projects in Panama that you’re eyeing, sort of Chinese investment or Chinese intervention in certain projects in Panama?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Yeah, but I don’t want to say anything. We just – it’s a broader – but the importance isn’t that China is out competing in the world. We welcome that. It’s when the state-owned enterprises show up in a way that is clearly not transparent, clearly not market-driven, and is designed not to benefit the people of Panama but rather to benefit the Chinese Government. Those are the kind of things we think are both inappropriate and not good for the people of Panama or any other country where China is engaged in this kind of predatory economic activity.


QUESTION: Did you discuss the possibility of any greater collaboration between the U.S. and Panama as part of the bilateral agreements?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Yeah, we hope so. We want to expand trade with them and they certainly want to expand trade with us as well, and so we do, and we hope too – we hope we can improve the counternarcotics efforts. It matters to Panama a great deal and it matters to us as well. We have lots of narcotics transiting through, around, and adjacent to Panama, and it’s a regional effort, and Panama has been a critical supporter of our efforts and we hope our – we have been of theirs as well.


QUESTION: If I could ask you about Mexico again. The President tweeted about sending military troops to the border for the caravan. What’s the status of that, of those discussions or decisions?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Yeah, I don’t have anything to add to the President’s statement this morning other than to say we’re determined to do the things we need to do, and one of the things we need to do is get Congress to change the rules that we have in a way that – frankly, in a way that most other countries have in their rules too. It’s important that we secure our borders and the President has not only the State Department but DHS and others working to achieve that goal.


QUESTION: Do you feel there has been progress in terms of stopping the caravan before it gets to Mexico?


SECRETARY POMPEO: I always like to see it work before I take credit for any achievement, so let’s see. Let’s see what progress has been made and what progress we can make over the coming days. I will say that the Mexican Government is working in good faith to try and help achieve this.


MS NAUERT: All right, we’ve got to wrap it up.


SECRETARY POMPEO: And I will take your Khashoggi question and only that one. I’ve seen no tape. I’ve seen no – or I’ve heard no tape. I’ve seen no transcript. And the network that reported that ought to pull down the headline that says I have.


MS NAUERT: Thanks, guys.


QUESTION: Thank you.


QUESTION: Thank you for speaking with us.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Do you work for ABC?


QUESTION: No, but --


SECRETARY POMPEO: You should actually ask them. They’re peers of yours. You should tell them that the Secretary of State is on the record saying this, and that they shouldn’t – they shouldn’t do that. This is wrong to do to the fiancé of Khashoggi. We should be factual when we’re reporting things about this. This is a very serious matter that we’re working diligently on. And so to put out headlines that are factually false does no one any good. You should encourage all your colleagues to behave that way. It’s most constructive when the media tells the truth. It’s very useful.

SECRETARY POMPEO: So let me just try and give you a summary of the short stay in Ankara.


	Had a good, constructive conversation with President Erdogan. The fact that Pastor Brunson has now made his way back to the United States I think opens up lots of opportunities. We talked about half a dozen topics. We talked about Iran, how we have Iran sanctions taking place November 4th. We are working with the Turks to make sure that we get to the right place. They buy Iranian crude oil; we’d like them to buy less. And there are a whole handful of issues around that that we have working groups engaged in, and I think we made a little bit of progress on that this morning as well. We talked about the work that we’re doing together in Syria, and I think Ambassador Jeffrey had a chance to talk with you all about that, so I won’t spend a lot of time on that. But President Erdogan is fully engaged in ensuring that Idlib Province remain inside the agreement that he struck, and we are hopeful that that will remain the case as well.


	We talked about the Khashoggi incident as well. He made clear that the Saudis had cooperated with the investigation that the Turks are engaged in, and that they’re going to share information that they learned with the Saudis as well. There’s been a couple of delays, but they seemed pretty confident that the Saudis were going to permit them to do the things that they needed to do to complete their thorough and complete investigation as well.


QUESTION: Sanctions on – Brunson-related sanctions, are you ready to lift those?


SECRETARY POMPEO: So we’ll have a decision on that shortly. But there were – some of the sanctions that were put in place were directly connected to Pastor Brunson, and there’s a logic to now removing those as well. But no final decision has been made. I need to talk to the President about that.


	But we did talk – we talked about that set of sanctions. We talked about work that we were doing in other places together as well.


QUESTION: Did you learn anything concrete about what they learned about – anything new they learned about Khashoggi?


SECRETARY POMPEO: No. They want to complete their investigation, and that they will have a process. I’m sure they will have their own prosecutors looking at this as well since it took place in their country, albeit on consulate property.


QUESTION: Have you heard or asked to hear the alleged audio on the actual murder?


SECRETARY POMPEO: I don’t have anything to say about that.


QUESTION: Do you believe that there actually was an incident that took place in the consulate after your talks here in Turkey?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Mr. Khashoggi is missing.


QUESTION: And do we think he’s missing from the consulate? Is that --


SECRETARY POMPEO: I’m not going to get ahead of – we have two countries conducting investigations. They’ll do that, and the world will get a chance to see the facts that they turn up through their investigations.


QUESTION: How high up do you think this goes? I mean, MBS told you guys that he didn’t --


SECRETARY POMPEO: They’re going to do their investigation. I know you all are going to ask questions. I’m going to be very consistent: We’re going to give them the space to complete their investigations of this incident, and when they issue their reports, we’ll form our judgment about thoroughness, depth, and the decisions they make about accountability connected to that.


QUESTION: But the Saudis lied initially saying that he left the building. I mean, that’s obviously clearly not --


SECRETARY POMPEO: We’ll see what the investigation shows.


MS NAUERT: Just a couple more questions; we’re going to have to get ready.


QUESTION: Sir, when – what we saw in public looks like business as usual. Could you talk a little bit about how the tenor of your private conversations being a bit different?


SECRETARY POMPEO: You mean with the Turks today?


QUESTION: With the – with the Saudis.


QUESTION: With the Saudis, excuse me.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Well, I think I’ve said all I’m going to say about the conversation with the Saudis. Look, we had very direct conversations about this, the seriousness of this, how serious President Trump is taking this, how seriously the United States will take this. No one should mistake that we’re looking to see the results of these investigations, too, that we think it’s important that they get them right, and we’re hopeful it’ll happen quickly as well. But as for responses that the United States will take, we need to know the facts before we can begin to formulate what the appropriate response for this would be.


	I do think it’s important that everyone keep in their mind that we have lots of important relationships – financial relationships between U.S. and Saudi companies, governmental relationships, things we work on together all across the world – efforts to reduce the risk to the United States of America from the world’s largest state sponsor of terror, Iran. The Saudis have been great partners in working alongside us on those issues. I could go on about places where the Saudis and the Americans are working together. Those are important elements of the U.S. national policy that are for – are in Americans’ best interests. We just need to make sure that we are mindful of that as we approach decisions that the United States Government will take when we learn all of the facts associated with whatever may have taken place.


QUESTION: But if it’s found that they actually killed a journalist, is that in America’s best interests in terms of values to be working with the Saudis as closely?


SECRETARY POMPEO: I’m not going to speculate. Obviously, if someone – if a country engages in an activity that is unlawful, it’s unacceptable. No one is going to defend activity of that nature. We’ll see what happens.


QUESTION: There has been some criticism that if you take off the table at the beginning that the relationship, this long-term relationship is not going to be harmed, that there’s less reason for the Saudis to take you seriously on this issue. What do you – how do you address that?


SECRETARY POMPEO: I’m convinced that the Saudis understand that America is taking this seriously and I am hopeful that the Saudis take this as seriously as they indicated to me yesterday that they would. Time will certainly tell; we’ll get to see the investigation and we’ll see the results of it. But I think they understand the serious nature of the work that they’re doing and the accusations that have been lodged against them as well.


QUESTION: Did you talk about Fethullah Gulen with the Turks?


SECRETARY POMPEO: We did. We did talk about Fethullah Gulen and we talked about the set of issues surrounding that organization as well. It’s something that the Turks remind us of often, and we’re mindful of places that we can work with them to make sure that we all have a shared set of facts as well.


SECRETARY POMPEO: But it’s mostly not a State Department issue; it’s mostly a Justice Department issue. So better for the Justice Department to answer questions about that than me.


MS NAUERT: Last one.


QUESTION: This --


MS NAUERT: Go ahead. You haven’t asked a question yet. Go right ahead.


QUESTION: Okay. My – I guess my question is with the Saudis and everything we’ve seen so far, do you trust them? What gives – why do you – you keep saying the investigation. We keep seeing a lot of stuff that’s just sort of with information coming out with they painted over, they painted the consulate, the – Senator Corker didn’t believe it when he talked to the Saudi ambassador to America when they said – and they talked about they didn’t have tapes of people coming in and out of their consulate. So why give them so much benefit of the doubt right now with their investigation to see where it comes?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Yeah, I keep hearing that we’re giving them some benefit of the doubt. They’re going to do an investigation, and when the investigation is done we’ll evaluate it. It’s not about benefit of the doubt. It’s that it is --


QUESTION: More about patience?


SECRETARY POMPEO: It’s reasonable to give them a handful of days more to complete it so they get it right, so that it’s thorough and complete, and that’s what they – that’s what they’ve indicated they need and I’m hopeful they – and then we’ll get to see it. We’ll evaluate this on a factual, straight-up basis.


MS NAUERT: We’ve got to go.


QUESTION: Just, well, you said a handful of days. Is that actually the timeframe that you’re thinking of?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Sooner is better than later. Yes. For everyone involved in this – for the family. I had a chance to speak to Jamal’s fiance. Sooner is better than later for everyone.


MS NAUERT: Okay, we’ve got to go.


QUESTION: Anything with the Turks on the S-300s or S-400s?


SECRETARY POMPEO: No, nothing to add. We talked about – we talked about issues related to our strategic cooperation on systems like that, but nothing to add in terms of where we’ll go from here.


MS NAUERT: Okay. Thanks, guys.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Thank you all.

SECRETARY POMPEO: We’re on our way to Turkey, where I’ll meet with President Erdogan this morning, if all goes as planned. Yesterday I had the chance to have a number of meetings, extended meetings, with King Salman and the crown prince, Adel al-Jubeir, the foreign minister. In each of those meetings I stressed the importance of them conducting a complete investigation into the disappearance of Jamal Khashoggi, and they made a commitment; they said they would do that and they said it would be a thorough, complete, and transparent investigation. We’ll all see the results of that. They made a commitment that they would show the entire world the results of their investigation. They also indicated they would get this done quickly. I don’t know the precise timeline, but they indicated that they understood the importance of getting that done in a timely, rapid fashion so that they could begin to answer important questions.


	We also had the chance to talk about lots of other elements of the relationship between our two countries. We have many overlapping interests, places we work together, places where Saudi Arabia and the United States are trying to achieve important things around the world, and we spent time discussing those as well.


QUESTION: Sir, did they tell you what happened to Jamal Khashoggi?


SECRETARY POMPEO: They told me they were going to conduct a thorough, complete, transparent investigation. They made a commitment, too, to hold anyone connected to any wrongdoing that may be found accountable for that, whether they are a senior officer or official. They promised accountability for each of those persons whom they determine as a result of their investigation has – deserves accountability.


QUESTION: Including a member of the royal family?


SECRETARY POMPEO: They made no exceptions to who they would hold accountable. They were just – they were very clear. They understand the importance of this issue. They are determined to get to the bottom of it, and that they will conduct the report, and we’ll all get a chance to see it. They each promised that they would achieve that for us.


QUESTION: And did they say that Mr. Khashoggi is alive or dead?


SECRETARY POMPEO: I don’t want to talk about any of the facts. They didn’t want to either, in that they want to have the opportunity to complete this investigation in a thorough way.


QUESTION: Do you believe the denials?


SECRETARY POMPEO: And I think that’s – I think that’s – I think that’s a reasonable thing to do to give them that opportunity, and then we’ll all get to judge, we’ll all get to evaluate the work that they do.


QUESTION: With the reports coming from Turkey, what gives you the benefit of the doubt of believing them so far right now?


SECRETARY POMPEO: I’m waiting for the investigation to be completed. They promised that they would achieve that, and I’m counting on it, and they gave me their word. And we’ll all get to see if they deliver against that commitment.


QUESTION: Did you talk about repercussions in case the Saudis are found to be involved?


SECRETARY POMPEO: We talked about the importance of completing the investigation.


QUESTION: And what happens if the Saudis are found to be involved, for the U.S.?


SECRETARY POMPEO: We talked about the importance of the investigation, completing it in a timely fashion, and making sure that it was sufficiently transparent that we could evaluate the work that had been done to get to the bottom of it. So that was the purpose of the visit. In that sense it was incredibly successful. We received commitments that they would complete this, and I am counting on them to do that. So thanks, everybody.


QUESTION: Did they tell you something different, though, in private about this?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Have a good morning and we’ll see you all on the other side.

	On Sunday, President Donald J. Trump directed me to travel to Saudi Arabia to impress upon Saudi Arabia’s leadership that it is essential to determine what happened to Jamal Khashoggi. Today, I met with King Salman, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, and Foreign Minister al-Jubeir and did just that.


	We had direct and candid conversations. I emphasized the importance of conducting a thorough, transparent, and timely investigation, and the Saudi leadership pledged to deliver precisely on that.


	This evening, the President called the Crown Prince, who conveyed that a serious and credible investigation is already underway. He pledged that the work of the Saudi public prosecutor will produce a full and complete conclusion with full transparency for the world to see.


	During each of today’s meetings the Saudi leadership strongly denied any knowledge of what took place in their consulate in Istanbul.


	My assessment from these meetings is that there is serious commitment to determine all the facts and ensure accountability, including accountability for Saudi Arabia’s senior leaders or senior officials.


	The President has asked me to travel to Turkey to meet with senior leaders. We will remain in close contact with Saudi and Turkish authorities as they complete this process and ultimately announce their findings.

"October 15, 2018","
	The end of the Cold War forced new thinking among policymakers and analysts about the greatest challenges to U.S. national security. The emergence of al Qaeda, cybercriminals, and other dangerous entities affirmed the threat of nonstate actors. But equally daunting has been the resurgence of outlaw regimes—rogue states that defy international norms, fail to respect human rights and fundamental freedoms, and act against the security of the American people, U.S. allies and partners, and the rest of the world.


	Chief among these outlaw regimes are North Korea and Iran. Their transgressions against international peace are many, but both nations are most notorious for having spent decades pursuing nuclear weapons programs in violation of international prohibitions. Despite Washington’s best efforts at diplomacy, Pyongyang hoodwinked U.S. policymakers with a string of broken arms control agreements going back to the George H. W. Bush administration. North Korea’s nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs continued apace, to the point where after Donald Trump was elected, President Barack Obama told him that this would be his greatest national security challenge. With Iran, likewise, the deal that the Obama administration struck in 2015—the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or JCPOA—failed to end the country’s nuclear ambitions. In fact, because Iran knew that the Obama administration would prioritize preserving the deal over everything else, the JCPOA created a sense of impunity on the part of the regime, allowing it to increase its support for malign activity. The deal has also given Tehran piles of money, which the supreme leader has used to sponsor all types of terrorism throughout the Middle East (with few consequences in response) and which have boosted the economic fortunes of a regime that remains bent on exporting its revolution abroad and imposing it at home.


	That the threats from North Korea and Iran grew in the post–Iraq war era has further complicated the question of how best to counteract them; Americans are rightly skeptical of the costs of a protracted military commitment in the name of protection from weapons of mass destruction. With the difficulties of Iraq fresh in mind, and with previous agreements to restrain the threats from North Korea and Iran having proved impotent, stopping these recalcitrant regimes from doing harm demands new diplomatic paradigms.


	Enter President Trump. For all of the Washington establishment’s fretting over his style of international engagement, his diplomacy is anchored in a deliberate approach that gives the United States an advantage in confronting outlaw regimes.


	Both on the campaign trail and in office, President Trump has been clear about the need for bold American leadership to put the United States’ security interests first. This commonsense principle reverses the Obama administration’s preferred posture of “leading from behind,” an accommodationist strategy that incorrectly signaled diminished American power and influence. Leading from behind made North Korea a greater threat today than ever before. Leading from behind at best only delayed Iran’s pursuit of becoming a nuclear power, while allowing the Islamic Republic’s malign influence and terror threat to grow.


	Today, both North Korea and Iran have been put on notice that the United States will not allow their destabilizing activities to go unchecked. The aggressive multinational pressure campaign that the United States has led against North Korea, combined with the president’s clear and unequivocal statements that the United States will defend its vital interests with force if necessary, created the conditions for the talks that culminated in President Trump’s summit with Chairman Kim Jong Un in Singapore this past June. It was there that Chairman Kim committed to the final, fully verified denuclearization of North Korea. North Korea has made similar commitments in the past, but unlike those, this was the first time there was a personal, leader-to-leader commitment on denuclearization. That may or may not signal a major strategic shift on the part of Chairman Kim, and we have much work to do to gauge his intentions and make sure his commitment is implemented. But President Trump’s approach has created an opportunity to peacefully resolve an issue of vital national security that has long vexed policymakers. The president, our special representative for North Korea (Stephen Biegun), and I will continue to work with clear eyes to seize this opportunity.


	With Iran, similarly, the Trump administration is pursuing a “maximum pressure” campaign designed to choke off revenues that the regime—and particularly the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), part of Iran’s military that is directly beholden to the supreme leader—uses to fund violence through Hezbollah in Lebanon, Hamas in the Palestinian territories, the Assad regime in Syria, the Houthi rebels in Yemen, Shiite militias in Iraq, and its own agents covertly plotting around the world.


	Yet President Trump does not want another long-term U.S. military engagement in the Middle East—or in any other region, for that matter. He has spoken openly about the dreadful consequences of the 2003 invasion of Iraq and the 2011 intervention in Libya. Pundits may gin up fear over the idea that this administration will get the United States into a war, but it is clear that Americans have a president who, while not afraid to use military power (just ask the Islamic State, the Taliban, or the Assad regime), is not eager to use it, either. Overwhelming military force will always be a backstop for protecting the American people, but it should not be the first option.


	Another important aspect of the president’s diplomacy is his willingness to talk to the United States’ staunchest adversaries. As he said in July, “Diplomacy and engagement is preferable to conflict and hostility.” Consider his approach to North Korea: his diplomacy with Chairman Kim diffused tensions that were escalating by the day.


	Complementing the president’s willingness to engage is his instinctual aversion to bad deals. His understanding of the importance of leverage in any negotiation eliminates the potential for deeply counterproductive agreements like the JCPOA. He is willing to forge agreements with U.S. rivals, but he is also comfortable walking away from negotiations if they don’t end up furthering U.S. interests. This is in stark contrast to the Obama administration’s approach to the JCPOA, in which the deal itself became an objective to be obtained at all costs.


	When considering a future North Korea deal that is superior to the JCPOA, we have described our objective as “the final, fully verified denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, as agreed to by Chairman Kim Jong Un.” “Final” means that there will be no possibility that North Korea will ever restart its weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missile programs—something the JCPOA did not provide for with Iran. “Fully verified” means that there will be stronger verification standards than were required under the JCPOA, which, among other weaknesses, did not require inspections at key Iranian military facilities. The exact contours of a North Korea agreement remain to be negotiated, but “final” and “fully verified” are centerpieces on which we will not compromise.


	President Trump’s commitment to the American people’s security, combined with his aversion to the unnecessary use of military force and his willingness to talk to adversaries, has provided a new framework for confronting outlaw regimes. And today, no regime has more of an outlaw character than that of Iran. That has been the case since 1979, when a relatively small cadre of Islamic revolutionaries seized power. The regime’s revolutionary mindset has motivated its actions ever since—in fact, soon after its founding, the IRGC created the Quds Force, its elite special forces unit, and tasked it with exporting the revolution abroad. Ever since, regime officials have subordinated all other domestic and international responsibilities, including their obligations to the Iranian people, to fulfilling the revolution.


	As a result, over the past four decades, the regime has sown a great deal of destruction and instability, bad behavior that did not end with the JCPOA. The deal did not permanently prevent Iran’s pursuit of a nuclear weapon—indeed, the statement in April by Iran’s top nuclear official that the country could restart its nuclear program in days suggests that it may not have delayed that program very much at all. Nor did the deal curtail Iran’s violent and destabilizing activity in Afghanistan, Iraq, Lebanon, Syria, Yemen, and Gaza. Iran still supplies the Houthis with missiles that are fired at Saudi Arabia, supports Hamas’ attacks on Israel, and recruits impressionable Afghan, Iraqi, and Pakistani youth to fight and die in Syria. Thanks to Iranian subsidies, the average Lebanese Hezbollah fighter earns two or three times per month what a fireman in Tehran brings home.


	In May 2018, President Trump withdrew from the nuclear deal because it was clearly not protecting the national security interests of the United States or our allies and partners, nor was it making Iran behave like a normal country. In July, an Iranian diplomat based in Vienna was arrested for supplying explosives to terrorists seeking to bomb a political rally in France. It is telling that while Iran’s leaders try to convince Europe to stay in the nuclear deal, they are covertly plotting terrorist attacks in the heart of the continent. Taken together, Iran’s actions have made the country a pariah, much to the despair of its own people.


	In place of the Iran nuclear deal, President Trump has initiated a multi-pronged pressure campaign. Its first component is economic sanctions. The president recognizes the power of sanctions to squeeze the regime while incurring a low opportunity cost for the United States. Under the Trump administration, the United States has imposed 17 rounds of Iran-related sanctions, targeting 147 Iran-related individuals and entities.


	The goal of these aggressive sanctions is to force the Iranian regime to make a choice: whether to cease or persist in the policies that triggered the measures in the first place. Iran’s decision to continue its destructive activity has already had grave economic consequences, which have been exacerbated by officials’ gross mismanagement in pursuit of their own self-interests. Extensive meddling in the economy by the IRGC, under the guise of privatization, makes doing business in Iran a losing proposition, and foreign investors never know whether they are facilitating commerce or terrorism. Instead of using what wealth the JCPOA has generated to boost the material well-being of the Iranian people, the regime has parasitically consumed it and shelled out billions in subsidies for dictators, terrorists, and rogue militias. Iranians are understandably frustrated. The rial’s value has collapsed in the past year. A third of Iranian youth are unemployed. Unpaid wages are leading to rampant strikes. Fuel and water shortages are common.


	This malaise is a problem of the regime’s own making. Iran’s elite resembles a Mafia in its racketeering and corruption. Two years ago, Iranians rightfully erupted in anger when leaked pay stubs showed massive amounts of money inexplicably flowing into the bank accounts of senior government officials. For years, clerics and officials have wrapped themselves in the cloak of religion while robbing the Iranian people blind. Today, protesters chant to the regime, “You have plundered us in the name of religion.” According to the London-based newspaper Kayhan, Ayatollah Sadeq Larijani, the head of Iran’s judiciary, who the United States sanctioned this year for human rights abuses, is worth at least $300 million, thanks to the embezzlement of public funds. Nasser Makarem Shirazi, a grand ayatollah, is also worth many millions of dollars. He became known as “the Sultan of Sugar” for having pressured the Iranian government to lower subsidies to domestic sugar producers while flooding the market with his own, more expensive imported sugar. This type of activity puts ordinary Iranians out of work. Ayatollah Mohammad Emami Kashani, one of the leaders of Friday prayers in Tehran for the last 30 years, had the government transfer several lucrative mines to his personal foundation. He, too, is now worth millions. The corruption goes all the way to the top. Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has his own personal, off-the-books hedge fund called the Setad, which is worth $95 billion. That untaxed and ill-gotten wealth, often earned by expropriating the assets of political and religious minorities, is used as a slush fund for the IRGC. In other words, Iran’s leading holy man captains the kind of plundering characteristic of Third World strongmen.


	The regime’s greed has created a chasm between the people of Iran and their leaders, making it difficult for officials to credibly persuade young Iranians to be the vanguard of the next generation of the revolution. The theocratic ayatollahs can preach “Death to Israel” and “Death to America” day and night, but they cannot mask their rank hypocrisy. Mohammad Javad Zarif, Iran’s foreign minister, has degrees from San Francisco State University and the University of Denver, and Ali Akbar Velayati, the supreme leader’s top adviser, studied at Johns Hopkins University. Khamenei himself is chauffeured around in a BMW, even as he calls for the Iranian people to buy goods made in Iran. This phenomenon is similar to what occurred in the Soviet Union in the 1970s and 1980s, when the spirit of 1917 began to ring hollow on account of the hypocrisy of its champions. The Politburo could no longer with a straight face tell Soviet citizens to embrace communism when Soviet officials were themselves secretly peddling smuggled blue jeans and Beatles records.


	Iran’s leaders—especially those at the top of the IRGC, such as Qasem Soleimani, the head of the Quds Force—must be made to feel the painful consequences of their violence and corruption. Given that the regime is controlled by a desire for self-enrichment and a revolutionary ideology from which it will not easily depart, sanctions must be severe if they are to change entrenched habits. That’s why the Trump administration is reimposing U.S. sanctions that were lifted or waived as part of the nuclear deal; the first of these went back into effect on August 7, with the remainder coming back on November 5. We intend to get global imports of Iranian crude oil as close to zero as possible by November 4. As part of our campaign to crush the Iranian regime’s terrorist financing, we have also worked with the United Arab Emirates to disrupt a currency exchange network that was transferring millions of dollars to the Quds Force. The United States is asking every nation that is sick and tired of the Islamic Republic’s destructive behavior to stand up for the Iranian people and join our pressure campaign. Our efforts will be ably led by our new special representative for Iran, Brian Hook.


	Economic pressure is one part of the U.S. campaign. Deterrence is another. President Trump believes in clear measures to discourage Iran from restarting its nuclear program or continuing its other malign activities. With Iran and other countries, he has made it clear that he will not tolerate attempts to bully the United States; he will punch back hard if U.S. security is threatened. Chairman Kim has felt this pressure, and he would never have come to the table in Singapore without it. The president’s own public communications themselves function as a deterrence mechanism. The all-caps tweet he directed at Iranian President Hassan Rouhani in July, in which he instructed Iran to stop threatening the United States, was informed by a strategic calculation: the Iranian regime understands and fears the United States’ military might. In September, militias in Iraq launched life-threatening rocket attacks against the U.S. embassy compound in Baghdad and the U.S. consulate in Basra. Iran did not stop these attacks, which were carried out by proxies it has supported with funding, training, and weapons. The United States will hold the regime in Tehran accountable for any attack that results in injury to our personnel or damage to our facilities. America will respond swiftly and decisively in defense of American lives.


	We do not seek war. But we must make painfully clear that escalation is a losing proposition for Iran; the Islamic Republic cannot match the United States’ military prowess, and we are not afraid to let Iran’s leaders know it.


	Another critical component of the U.S. pressure campaign against Iran is a commitment to exposing the regime’s brutality. Outlaw authoritarian regimes fear nothing more than having the lid blown off their true workings. The Trump administration will continue to reveal the regime’s illicit revenue streams, malign activities, crooked self-dealing, and savage oppression. The Iranian people themselves deserve to know the grotesque level of self-interest that fuels the regime’s actions. Khamenei and his ilk would not be able to tolerate the domestic and international outrage that would ensue if everything they were up to came to light. Beginning last year, protesters have taken to the street saying, “Leave Syria, think about us!” and “The people are paupers while the mullahs live like gods!” The United States stands with the Iranian people.


	U.S. President Ronald Reagan understood the power of exposure when he cast the Soviet Union as “an evil empire.” By throwing a spotlight on the regime’s abuses, he was pledging solidarity with a people who had long suffered under communism. It is likewise for the sake of the Iranian people that the Trump administration has not been afraid to expose the regime’s merciless domestic repression. The regime is so wedded to certain ideological principles—including the export of the Islamic Revolution through proxy warfare and the subversion of fellow Muslim-majority countries, implacable opposition to Israel and the United States, and stringent social controls that restrict the rights of women—that it cannot endure any competing ideas. Hence, it has for decades denied its own people human rights, dignity, and fundamental freedoms. That is why in May, for example, Iranian police arrested Maedeh Hojabri, a teenage gymnast, for posting an Instagram video of herself dancing.


	The regime’s views on women are particularly retrograde. Since the revolution, women have been required to wear the hijab, and as enforcement, government morality police beat women in the streets and arrest those who refuse to comply. Recent protests against this policy on female dress show that it has failed, and Khamenei surely must know it. Yet in July, an activist was sentenced to 20 years in prison for removing her hijab.


	The regime also regularly arrests religious or ethnic minorities, including Bahais, Christians, and Gonabadi dervishes, when they speak out in support of their rights. Untold numbers of Iranians are tortured and die in Evin Prison—a place no kinder than the basement of the Lubyanka, the dreaded headquarters of the kgb. Those imprisoned include several innocent Americans detained on spurious charges, victims of the regime’s use of hostage taking as a tool of foreign policy.


	Beginning last December, demonstrators took to the streets of Tehran, Karaj, Isfahan, Arak, and many other cities to peacefully call for a better life. In response, the regime welcomed in the new year in January by arbitrarily arresting up to 5,000 of them. Hundreds reportedly remain behind bars, and more than a dozen are dead at the hands of their own government. The leaders cynically call these deaths suicide.


	It is in keeping with the character of the United States that we expose these abuses. As President Reagan said in a speech at Moscow State University in 1988, “Freedom is the recognition that no single person, no single authority or government, has a monopoly on the truth, but that every individual life is infinitely precious, that every one of us put on this world has been put there for a reason and has something to offer.” In May, the Trump administration enumerated 12 areas in which Iran must make progress if there is to be any change in our relationship, including fully halting its uranium enrichment, providing a full account of the prior military dimensions of its nuclear program, ending its proliferation of ballistic missiles and provocative missile launches, releasing imprisoned U.S. citizens, ending its support for terrorism, and more.


	President Trump has made clear that the pressure will only increase if Iran does not live up to the standards the United States and its partners and allies—and the Iranian people themselves—want to see. That is why Washington is also demanding that Tehran make substantial improvements on human rights. As the president has consistently said, he remains open to talks. But as is the case with North Korea, the United States will continue its pressure campaign until Iran demonstrates tangible and sustained shifts in its policies. If Iran makes those shifts, the possibility of a new comprehensive agreement will greatly increase. We think a deal with the regime is possible. In the absence of one, Iran will face increasing costs for all its reckless and violent activity around the world.


	President Trump prefers not to conduct this campaign alone; he wants U.S. allies and partners on board. Indeed, other countries already share a common understanding of the threat Iran poses beyond its nuclear aspirations. French President Emmanuel Macron has said, “It is important to remain firm with Iran over its regional activities and its ballistic program”; British Prime Minister Theresa May has said that she is “clear-eyed about the threat that Iran poses to the Gulf and the wider Middle East.” This widespread agreement about the Iranian threat leaves no room for countries to remain ambivalent about whether to join the global effort to change Iran’s behavior, an effort that is big and getting bigger.


	President Trump inherited a world in some ways as dangerous as the one faced by the United States on the eve of World War I, the one right before World War II, or that during the height of the Cold War. But his disruptive boldness, first on North Korea and now on Iran, has shown how much progress can be made by marrying clarity of conviction with an emphasis on nuclear nonproliferation and strong alliances. President Trump’s actions in confronting outlaw regimes stem from the belief that moral confrontation leads to diplomatic conciliation.


	This was the blueprint for one of the great foreign policy triumphs of the last century: the American victory in the Cold War. In the first week of his presidency, President Reagan described Soviet leaders, saying, “The only morality they recognize is what will further their cause, meaning they reserve unto themselves the right to commit any crime, to lie, to cheat.” Foreign policy analysts derided his comments, believing their candor would hinder progress toward peace. But the president had also emphasized a commitment to negotiate with the Soviets, a fact that went largely ignored. President Reagan’s combination of moral clarity and diplomatic acuity laid the groundwork for the 1986 talks in Reykjavik and, later, the downfall of Soviet communism itself.


	Those who still bow to the same totemic conviction that candor impedes negotiations must recognize the effect that targeted rhetorical and practical pressure have had—and are having—on outlaw regimes. At the rate that the Iranian economy is declining and protests are intensifying, it should be clear to the Iranian leadership that negotiations are the best way forward.

	It was an honor to chair this Administration’s first meeting of the President’s Interagency Task Force to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons. Today I was proud to be joined by several members of the U.S. Advisory Council on Human Trafficking. They set a courageous example of service for the United States, and for the world, by choosing to transform their harrowing experiences into powerful advocacy. I was honored to present the Presidential Award for Extraordinary Efforts to Combat Trafficking in Persons to Ms. Minal Patel Davis and Mr. William C. Woolf III.


	The U.S. government is seeking new ways to leverage input from human trafficking survivors to strengthen federal policy and programming efforts. The State Department is doing its part through four key initiatives:


	Last year, we launched the Program to End Modern Slavery, a congressionally-funded U.S. foreign assistance program that seeks to achieve a measurable reduction in the prevalence of modern slavery in specific countries or regions. The Program began with an initial investment of $25 million for the Global Fund to End Modern Slavery, and now we have just awarded a second contribution of $25 million to the Global Fund and the University of Georgia Research Foundation to continue this important work. Congress has made yet another $25 million available for fiscal year 2018, which will bring our total investment for this important Program to $75 million.


	The Department’s Domestic Worker In-person Registration Program will expand to two new cities in 2019. This program was developed to enhance protection and oversight of foreign domestic workers employed by foreign mission and international organization personnel.


	The State Department will release a new “Know Your Rights” video that will air in U.S embassies and consulates to increase visa applicants’ awareness of their rights, help them identify human trafficking situations, and lead them to both avoid and report suspicious activity.


	And finally, the State Department just awarded a contract to create the Human Trafficking Expert Consultant Network, which will allow us to meaningfully incorporate survivor input into the Department’s anti-trafficking work, while compensating survivors for their expertise.

SECRETARY POMPEO: Well, good morning. Buenos dias. I would like to thank Vice President Pence, Secretary Nielsen, our Mexican co-hosts Foreign Secretary Videgaray and Government Secretary Navarrete for being here today. I also want to recognize the representatives of the incoming Mexican administration as well. We look forward to working with you.


	I would also like to welcome President Hernandez of Honduras, President Morales of Guatemala, and Vice President Ortiz of El Salvador. Welcome all.


	On a sad note, on behalf of the American people, our hearts go out to the loved ones of those killed in recent torrential rains across Central America, as well as those thousands who have been evacuated or otherwise impacted. A very serious matter. We were kidding that it’s Hurricane Miguel, but not named after either one of us. (Laughter.)


	You should know, in all seriousness, the United States stands with our Central American friends during these challenging and difficult times.


	I’m looking forward to our important conversations today on how we can improve security, prosperity, and governance in Central America. We must all work together to secure our borders, protect our citizens, and increase opportunities for legitimate businesses to invest in the region.


	For our part, we know that if our partners in Central America are stronger, the United States will be stronger as well.


	And I want to start things off this morning by inviting Vice President Pence to give remarks. Mr. Vice President, the floor is yours, sir.


	(The Vice President Pence gives remarks)


SECRETARY POMPEO: Thank you very much, Mr. Vice President. I now invite each country to give opening remarks. We will begin with President Hernandez of Honduras.


PRESIDENT HERNANDEZ: (Via interpreter) Good morning, Vice President Pence, Secretary Pompeo. Thank you for having us here. It’s a great pleasure. Secretary Nielsen, our colleague the President Morales, Vice President Ortiz, Chancellor, Foreign Minister, everybody who’s here with us this morning.


	I would like to start, Mr. Vice President, by expressing in the name of the Honduran people our sincerest expressions of solidarity because of Hurricane Michael, which is affecting several states in this country. We very much appreciate that at this time of crisis you’re giving us your time, your space, and tell you that I’m totally identified with your pain, because Honduras right now is evaluating the impact of climate change, which has been very strong. And I understand what it means to absent oneself from a national emergency for a few hours. I have to go back this very afternoon, hoping that the climate and the weather will allow me to.


	But I’m a person who always carries out his word, and I said this to Secretary Pompeo: We’re friends, and we will always be with you, and that’s why we’re here. This new tragedy in Honduras has also caused – already caused the loss of nine lives, 18,000 families affected, more than 16 communities that are – have lost communication, and great impact on the infrastructure and the productive sector, especially okra, sugar, shrimp, and where losses are almost one half of a point of our production. But this will surely cause a new wave of migration, because if you recall, it was right after Hurricane Mitch in 1998 when the United States extended a friendly hand and gave temporary protected status to almost 100,000 Hondurans, changing the lives of many people. And I absolutely must thank Mexico for the support that they gave us; also it was the first country to do so, and we will always remember that.


	I think it’s important to mention this today because Honduras, although it’s in a geographically privileged position, that position also makes us very vulnerable to climate. The last report from a prestigious institute reflects that in the last 20 years, Honduras has been in the entire world – and I repeat, in the entire world – the country that has been most affected by climate. And just to give you an idea, two months ago we had a drought which was an emergency, and now we have an emergency because of excessive rain.


	Mr. Vice President, the conditions that I have described are very serious. They were not the same conditions when – that existed when you terminated temporary protected status, which is why now thousands of people have to go back to Honduras, and many of them have to go back to these places that are under red alert because of a national emergency. And just as I was coming to Washington, we were already seeing reports of more climate disturbance coming from Panama towards Honduras. Through you, Mr. Vice President, I request your country’s support, with a solution for these Hondurans who are in irregular migratory situations.


	In the Alliance for Prosperity for the Northern Triangle, which has been our initiative since 2014 – it’s been ours, Central Americans’. We have committed to it, we have carried it out, and not just that; we have gone beyond our own expectations. Just in 2018 the three Northern Triangle countries assigned more than $3 billion – our own resources – for the objectives of the Alliance for Prosperity. This very high amount just represents our efforts in a single year. In the case of Honduras, we have been very tenacious and made a lot of sacrifices, but I believe that if our decision is to continue to progress, we need the political will and true commitment, as my commitment – as my government has had since the beginning and which I reiterate today.


	We have to define those things that have not worked, and that’s what we’re working on is – too, we need to evaluate lessons learned and continue with what we’ve done well. We see that every year there is a reduction in the resources that are budgeted by the United States. This should not take us to the conclusion that you’ve lost interest in your relationship with me, but it does concern us. How does the U.S. see the future of our region? Vice President Pence has announced these increases in migration, but in past years we had – we were more successful, so we have to see what we have to do to get improved numbers.


	Every year we have less and less financial assistance, and this year the proposal to the U.S. Congress was less than it was for 2018. We need to have assurances that we will have the necessary budget. Honduras’s budget for next year is increasing, which is why the vice president has said in Guatemala and has said here that we will have more presence at the border and it will be stronger because that’s what we have planned. Which also makes us wonder what can we expect in the short term from our very important relationship with Mexico. Throughout this year, we’ve had many meetings, but I believe that this moment is key, critical, and determining. We need to define the future of our plan because we, the Hondurans, cannot stop it and we won’t stop it. We’ve already made a roadmap and we will go ahead, whether it’s alone or the hope of – with the hope of working together.


	When we started with the Alliance for Prosperity we committed to find solutions for the migration crisis which was occurring in our countries, with the work of several different departments working on the different pillars of the plan. I should also talk about the task force work that’s carried by our country’s first lady, what has been very important. Now, during 2017, Honduras reduced immigration in 36 – by 36 percent, which made us very optimistic. But our circumstances today are very different. The numbers are going back up. Apprehensions on the border have increased significantly. And we have to pay attention to this and act on it. That is the gangs and transnational organized crime reinvent themselves, sometimes more efficiently than governments do. Gangs have gone on to extortion. They work with parallel organized crime groups, destabilizing our communities and displacing our people and breaking up the peace in our daily lives.


	In my country we have faced all these groups in a frontal way, which is something that I share with President Donald Trump. We have to create a strategy that is joint and effective against these problems. We have seen cases from the Northern Triangle countries where the gangs are sending orders to the United States, and vice versa. That is to say, it is an organized international crime group. That’s why I call to us to unite under a petition that we made at the UN to recognize that these armed groups that are non-state are violating basic human rights. I repeat, Vice President Pence, friends of Mexico, Guatemala, and El Salvador, let’s work together so that at the United Nations these armed non-state groups are considered as human rights violators.


	I must acknowledge that in the issue of security, there has been progress on the side of our countries, but until we manage to eradicate problems completely, as we said when we started with the plan, also tackling the demand for drugs from the north, our countries will continue to be victims of the consequences of drug trafficking. This will force our people to leave to look for opportunities.


	This is why I’d like to reiterate it is highly alarming for the region – and I repeat, it is highly alarming for the region – to see the increase in the production of drugs in the south of the continent. We all know, and we have said this for the last couple of years, there has been an increase in coca plantations in Colombia and in other countries in the south of the continent. There’s clear evidence of this. These drugs will move towards the north. And if this happens, this will be a wave of pain for us. This will create displacement and migration. We see the victims of that reality.


	And there is no way I cannot talk about the impact this has on Central American children. We have a solution for the 119 Honduran children who have been separated from their parents here in the United States. We have a solution in mind, Secretary Nielsen. If you look at your conscience, if we all put ourself in the shoes of these parents – imagine if a child from your country found himself or herself in that situation, you could understand the rejection this has caused in my country, the huge pressure we face. It is a matter of humanity. And it is impossible to understand for some how an issue that is in the biggest interest of children and family reunification – well, this continues to be a pending matter. I cannot go back to Honduras without an answer.


	Likewise, we need to candidly approach geopolitical events and humanitarian crisis that are causing instability in the region. The dictatorial regime in Venezuela has been disruptive for the region. This regime attacks fundamental democratic rights. We need to bear in mind also the situation in Nicaragua, which also has impact on the hemisphere and which needs to be approached because of the cascading effects that have an impact on neighboring countries and others.


	With the United States, we share values and principles vis-a-vis democracy. We have also supported the right to decide when and how to align foreign policy, as is the case with regards to Israel, a country with which we work closely. For decades Honduras has been in close relationship with Taiwan, and we continue to do so.


	At the same time, we are seeing an increase in the presence in our region by continental China and Russia. It would be desirable to see an increase in the opportunities of investment and trade with clear rules, but it would be of concern if what we are thinking about is a return to the ’80s, the time when Central America found itself as the location for geopolitical conflict. Hence, the importance of understanding the intentions of China, the intentions of Russia, and knowing more clearly what we can expect from our friend, the United States.


	Threats to regional security, sovereignty, and political stability are increasingly interrelated. In the speech given a month ago at the Federalist Society, Ambassador John Bolton said the following: No commission from a different country will tell us how to govern ourselves. And I agree with that. The Honduran Government shares fully the importance of sovereignty, full respect to sovereignty, and you, Vice President Pence, have reiterated this in our conversations.


	Honduras also agrees with the non-interference in the matters of other countries, and I paid attention to President Trump’s speech at the UN in this regards. We believe these principles have to always be respected. And in this neighborly alliance – and undoubtedly we have this sound friendship with the United States, and this sound friendship is part of what we believe should be our present and future for the region.


	Likewise, I’d like to underscore a problem coffee-producer countries are facing. This is contributing to inequality, and in Honduras right now 90,000 families of small coffee producers are moving from being small producers to finding themselves in extreme poverty, given the unfair prices of coffee. On average, a cup of coffee could be five dollars in New York. Of those five dollars, maybe two cents reach coffee producers in Honduras. This is giving rise to migration. This is deepening poverty and creating hopelessness. Secretary Pompeo, Vice President Pence, there are – we are competing with countries that do not have the same standards we meet, looking to protect environment and labor standards.


	Coffee in Honduras represents almost five percent of our GDP. This can show you the impact this can have. We need to underscore the need for equality and fairness in the coffee industry from the bean to the cup. At the same time, as consumers, we need to value the work behind the coffee we drink every day and become aware of the need for fair pay, giving our producers one more reason to remain in our countries.


	To conclude, I’d like to remind everyone that the commitments we undertake at these meetings can change lives. I am certain that the biggest desire for a Honduran young person is to be able to be fulfilled in his or her own country, having a family and dream with a prosperous and safe country. Let’s not deprive future generations from those dreams. Within the framework of our responsibilities, let’s face gangs, drug traffic, and lack of opportunity and inequality.


	This is the time for us to be remembered for our commitment and our tireless fight to build a stable region, a region that is safe and prosperous as well. Dear friends, you have my firm commitment and willingness to continue working in this fight. When history judges us, I want them to remember Juan Orlando Hernandez and Honduras in this conference as someone that always worked for this alliance of the Northern Triangle with the United States and Mexico. I could not allow myself to be found in a different place of history. Thank you, Mr. Vice President.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Thank you very much. President Morales of Guatemala, we welcome your remarks.


PRESIDENT MORALES: (Via interpreter) Thank you very much. Good morning. Mr. Vice President Pence; Mr. Juan Orlando Hernandez, president of Honduras; Mr. Ortiz, vice president of El Salvador; Mr. Videgaray, foreign affairs minister of Mexico; Secretary Nielsen, Secretary for national security and the Homeland Security in the United States of America, everyone, good morning.


	We echo this mention of solidarity, given the disasters caused by Hurricane Mike, and if we can be of help as friendly nation, please take us into account. It will be our privilege. We also would like to express solidarity with the countries that have suffered rains and floods in the region with these landslides. We are also at your disposal, if we can be of help to you.


	With regards to the last conversation we had in Guatemala, one of our commitments had to do with carrying out awareness-raising campaigns to prevent irregular emigration of Guatemalans, who’d be endangering their lives trying to come looking for opportunities in the United States. I’d like to thank the recognition of the leadership the first lady, my wife, has assumed carrying out different activities with many institutions to raise awareness that most of Guatemalan population to that effect.


	The three issues discussed at that meeting had to do with migration, prosperity and work, drug trafficking and border security. In the case of the fight against drug trafficking, DEA, the ambassador before the United Nations, Nikki Haley, and also INL and other organizations, investigation organization of the United States, say that Guatemala is the main ally in the region in the fight against drug trafficking.


	I have information I will share with you, information provided by these institutions in the United States. In two years and a half, we have exceeded the seizures of drugs of 12 years in the past. This is truly unprecedented. We also have information from the Southern Command saying that the Pacific in Guatemala, over 200 nautical miles, have gone down from 45 to 15 percent with regards to the transport of drugs, and our 200 nautical miles are free. And we have been working in joint operations with Colombia, Mexico, the United States, and Guatemala so that the 400 nautical miles in the Pacific in Guatemala become an impossible place for those trying to transport drugs. We have five boats that have been donated by the United States with autonomous capacity for 200 nautical miles only. We have already covered 300 nautical miles, exceeding thus 50 percent of their autonomy level. I’d like to thank my naval forces and my police officers who have been working in an exemplary fashion.


	Of course, there are many more pieces of data we will share with you, but we’d like them to be considered when we discuss our fight against drug trafficking and the issue of security. We undertook a commitment so as to become certified by the United States. Whenever we have complied with requests, the United States has changed the conditions. For us, this has been complicated with regards to the Alliance for Prosperity. We made a commitment to remove the army from the patrol duties on the street. For many years we were not able to do so, but we did that in a year and a half. We were able to remove the army from patrol duties. This does not mean our land has no protection. What we did was increase the civilian police forces: 4,000 in 2016 and 2017, 4,000 in 2018 – excuse me, 18 – 8,000 between 2016 and ’17 and 4,000 in 2018. This means that today we have over 40,000 civilian national police members protecting the country, and the army has been taken to the borders so as to be able to strengthen our binational forces in the groups – work groups we have with Mexico, El Salvador, Honduras, and which will soon increase with Belize as well.


	With regards to the fight against criminal organizations, in 2018 and 2017 we were able to capture 1,250 gang members from gangs Mara Salvatrucha and Barrio 18, thus disarticulating about 150 criminal structures that were taking part in extortion, murder, and kidnappings. All of this has been done with information we’ve been sharing in our joint work in the Northern Triangle.


	In 2009 we were one of the most dangerous countries, with a murder rate of 49 murders per 100,000 inhabitants. By 2015 we were able to reduce this to 30 murders per 100,000 inhabitants. During my government, 2016, 2017, and 2018, we have been able to reduce this rate to 22.9 murders per 100,000 inhabitants, bearing in mind that in Latin America the average is 23.5 percent per 100,000 inhabitants. We were able to achieve this working on internal security, on the strengthening of our borders, and of course, the fight against drug trafficking, which we all know carries with it destruction and death.


	As Foreign Affairs Minister Videgaray said, one of the problems we have faced is not only the issue of production in the south for consumption in the north, we are also seeing the same production in the center and also consumption in the center. We have eradicated 417 million plants of poppy last year. Just with this eradication, this equals $1.4 billion which would have – due to heroin production which would then be taken to the markets that consume it. This has strengthened the second issue, which has to do with the strengthening of our borders, because in our borders – that used to be and continue to be highly porous – is where we are being able to find this kind of problem.


	There is another issue I’d like to mention. We have arrested almost 100 people highly linked to terrorist groups, specifically ISIS. We have not only detained them in our territory, they have also been deported to their countries of origin. All of you here have information to that effect.


	With regards to prosperity, we’ve worked hard for the transparency and integrity of our administration – will allow us to make savings and appropriate investments in the country. We have been congratulated and we have increased 26 places in the Open Government Initiative, an initiative pushed by the United States itself through its own open government policy. We also worked with the Organization of American States to provide information to that effect. We also worked with the OECD based in Europe, on which deals with transparency matters. And the day before yesterday, we were accepted for accession to a study so as to become one of the countries that meets all of the necessary transparency indices and governance on accountability indices.


	Always, on the issue of transparency and public administration, I do not know whether you have heard here about ISO certifications. ISO certifications are based in Mexico. They provide quality certifications. Their best-known standard is ISO-9001. Both public and private enterprises can be certified according to their level of quality. The General Secretariat, this is the secretariat of the president’s office, was certified with standard ISO-9001 and also with ISO-37001. This is the only presidential office to attain this certification. Not even the United States or any capital in Europe has it. This is the certification that has to do with the fight against bribery, certification 37001. With this, I am trying to convey that the president’s office of Guatemala can humbly tell you that if someone is leading the fight against corruption in Guatemala, it’s the president’s office.


	We have some problems and we’d like to put them on the table. We’ve suffered international interference that has taken over our courts of justice. The fact that they have – had power now in courts have deprived us from the possibility of working as president’s office, and they are – that’s also affecting you. The main court in my country is the constitutional court. The constitutional court has infringed the political constitution of the republic, and it has also gone against the Vienna Convention. I said so at my speech in the UN. Judges and magistrates have been appointed who have made decisions against the government and against companies and American capital. And allow me to share an example. There’s a mine, San Rafael mine, 60 percent American – 60 percent Canadian capital, 40 percent American capital. Five hundred days with work stoppage, having invested $1 billion on the mine. This company has lost over 35 percent of the value of its shares of the stock market in the United States. This because there has been interference. This mine can also provide you information.


	The information has been provided through your senators about the fact that they have stopped hiring about 2,500 individuals. They already have photographs of people who haven’t had jobs at that mine, have had to come to the United States to look for jobs. There is a survey: Out of 2,500 people, 75 are already thinking about migrating to the United States. One question: Who has interfered in our courts? I’ve already said so a year and a half. Mr. Guterres, the secretary-general of the United Nations, did not listen to us. He didn’t understand that interference in other courts through CICIG and other international powers, this can break down the economy of a country.


	Finally, I can guarantee to you that with validated indicators, validated by American institutions, our security indicators, our indicators on the quality of our expenditure, the fight against drug trafficking, the fight against terrorism, and the fight against all of the threats that endanger our region. And as I said before, Guatemala by plane is closer than Washington than Los Angeles is to Washington, and for us this is very important, and it represents an opportunity, an opportunity of closeness, of work and cooperation.


	Allow me to conclude by saying that we, the plan of the Alliance for Prosperity of our budget in the last – in the two years and a half I’ve been in office, we have invested about 15 billion quetzales. This equals $2 billion. This is what we have invested, based on the priorities set by the United States Department of State, focusing on the areas where there was the greatest migration of individuals. To do so, I had to not consider as priorities 17 departments – that is to say, almost 75 percent of my territory, so as to comply with the Alliance for Prosperity plan.


	So far, we have not received a cent. We had – 50 percent has been approved and from the United States, we have heard that maybe they will not certify the remaining 50 percent. Humbly, respectfully, we’d like to make a different proposal, a simple proposal. We think we are an excellent ally of the United States and we want to be even better. We’d welcome your helping us have institutions such as the IDB or the World Bank or other financial institutions giving us $15 billion for infrastructure projects. In the next 30 years, we could pay the interest of that capital.


	Having all of the transparency elements necessary for investments on roads, infrastructure, courts, to strengthen our borders as well – this is a project we have had with Mexico. Mexico was able to do so. We were not able to invest in infrastructure in our border areas, but if we had access to credit, with credits we can actually repay, and with all of the possibilities for investments to be done in a transparent fashion, we’d be the first ones to be interested in strengthening the south of the United States and the north of Central America.


	So as to conclude, big projects, such as the ones we’ve done with Honduras in a customs union that has been unprecedented, joining the north of Central America, uniting it with El Salvador, and the possibility of having through that investments – this will give us jobs and allow us to strengthen our security. We are always at your disposal to provide service. We want to be your best allies in the region.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Thank you, Mr. President. Vice President Ortiz, please.


VICE PRESIDENT ORTIZ: (Via interpreter) Thank you. Allow me to convey regards to all of you. Thank you, Vice President Pence, for meeting with us today. Of course, Secretary Pompeo, Secretary Nielsen, and everyone that makes it possible for us to meet here today for the second Conference on Prosperity and Security in Central America.


	I’d like to also address the President of Honduras Juan Orlando Hernandez, the President of Guatemala Jimmy Morales, the teams accompanying them, of course the Foreign Affairs Minister of Mexico Mr. Videgaray, Government Minister Navarrete, and very specially on behalf of our country I’d like to acknowledge the work of Foreign Affairs Minister Videgaray has carried out, such an important player in this effort we started in 2016 and which has been strengthened during the last two years, this joint effort that we have outlined for the countries of Honduras, Guatemala, El Salvador, known as the Northern Triangle region.


	These would not have been possible without this shared vision with strategic partners such as the United States and, of course, Mexico, which is about to embark on a historic transition, and we give our best wishes to the incoming team we hope as a country. And as the Northern Triangle, we’ll have a reinforced effort from Mexico because of the multiple interests and the multiple operations that we are carrying out and will continue to carry out in all of the goals that we have set forth in the efforts that we are making in the Northern Triangle.


	We, as a country, add our voice to the solidarity, of course, of the thousands of families that have been affected by this natural phenomenon known as Michael, which is affecting many states of the United States, but also affecting Central America especially, and our brother people of Honduras. We continue to be affected by that tropical depression. There are people who are being taken care of by our civil services, and we think that the most important thing is to save lives, to prevent the loss of human life, and also of goods and services in the communities. Logically, this is something that must be at the center of our agenda for the future in the Northern Triangle, which as to do with the environment and the negative impact that the climate can have in our next few years that will affect our goals and objectives.


	I bring the best wishes of our President Salvador Sanchez Ceren, who could not be here at this important second conference, and it’s because this is a historic week in our country. The president is going to Rome, because as of Friday we begin the transcendental events where there will be – they are going to canonize Oscar Arnulfo Romero, which is going to be a historic event. He will be the first saint from our country, and this is important not just for El Salvador but for Latin America and the world. So I send the apologies.


	With this shared vision, as partners that we are, the shared vision which was built in 1996, which is being strengthened over the years, and that has the very fundamental goal of how to generate prosperity, how to generate greater security, and especially greater democracy in our countries. And within all of those efforts, which were brought together in this agenda, there is an issue that all of us agree on. If our countries are stable, prosperous, and create more opportunities, it’s very clear that the first thing we are going to have in the next few years will be a reduction of irregular migration to other borders, especially Mexico, which is a passing point, but particularly the United States. We have been working in a very organized and planned and structured fashion with the commitments that we took on as Northern Triangle.


	As one example, just this year El Salvador has reduced by 60 percent the irregular migration to the southern border of the United States. In our case I would say this is historic, because very few times have we had such an important decrease in irregular migration. Of course, this is not a final point, this is not a solution. This issue that affects Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras has to be sustainable. And for it to be sustainable, what we have to create in all three countries is more investment, and make the economy the central point of our countries, and dignified employment for – especially for our young people. And when I say “dignified,” that’s the only thing that allows us to invest in families and communities, and when we invest in families and communities, obviously we reinforce the hope and the dreams of those people being able to better their lives and their futures within their countries.


	That is the whole point of the Alliance for Prosperity. If we don’t have greater investment in our countries – El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras – we can’t talk about sustainability at the short, medium, and long term. And it’s here that we have the central issue of the exchange that we’re having here. How are we going to mobilize with our strategic partners in the next five to 10 years greater investment, not just from the U.S. Government, but from important businesses in the United States? How do we open new markets for our markets into the United States, and how do we generate a greater presence of Mexico, which 10 years ago was the second-greatest investor after the United States, and today it’s the third because Colombia got ahead of it? So after the United States it’s Colombia that invests more in El Salvador, and we would like Mexico to champion us again, to be a greater investor, because Mexico is good for us because we are the great Mesoamerican corridor, and we’re connected not just by language, we’re connected by tradition. We have more things in common than differences. So it’s important to talk very concretely here about the short term.


	How can Mexico take on this shared vision with the United States as a historic presence, and it will always be that way because that’s the way we want it to be? I don’t think anybody is going to displace the United States as the great partner for the Northern Triangle, but Mexico can be the factor of increasing added value in addition to the wonderful work that’s been done as a cohost and dynamo for the Northern Triangle. And of course, as a country we’re going to ask the new president of Mexico to be more present in the region. And it’s a win-win situation because as we ensure the Mesoamerican corridor, we are ensuring the future stability of all of us. And we’ve done our work in the Northern Triangle. It’s a process. We can’t believe that these issues of prosperity and employment will be solved in the short term. These are processes that require time.


	And I’d like to say that of the commitments that we took on last year at the first conference we had in Miami, where we committed – and I can tell you that one of the first commitments, as I just told you, is reducing by 60 percent the irregular migration out of El Salvador. But we have to consolidate this. We’re doing our part on the economic part. You know that in the last three years, just in public investment, we have put in more than 2 billion program – dollars into these programs that we continue to work on. Just in the budget for 2019 that we just presented to parliament, which we hope will be approved, there’s a – there are $10 billion more. So if we add up 2017, 2018, 2019, there’s more than $3 billion that have been spent on this purpose.


	And what happened this year in the 2017/18, we’re about to close the customs union between the three countries. And President Orlando has been a champion here. We have to recognize that. I was with him when they launched this program in Honduras and Guatemala. And then El Salvador decided to enter into that union with all of our good will. And we can say today that, starting in November, Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala are in a customs union. That is to say we practically – more than 60 percent of our trade – there’s more than 68 percent of the trade in the area is between the three of us. More than 30,000 people are involved. And this what the Northern Triangle represents. This customs union is a key step, because we are not going to be exporting more than 60 percent of our products. We’re just going to be moving them very ­— quicker. That’s going to make the economy of the triangle grow. It’s going to open up new employment opportunities as well as investment, increasing investment.


	One of the issues we’ve also talked about is energy. The electric interconnection in Central America has advanced. You know that Guatemala has the greatest offer, and we want them to integrate with Mexico so that they can keep prices down, because as we have lower energy prices it allows us to have other opportunities in competitiveness. But we’re also mobilizing strong investment. In our case, just for the next two years, we have committed to more than a billion dollars just into energy. We’re using wind power, solar power. We’re going to have an investment of more than $800 million. This is what Guatemala is doing, Honduras is doing. We’re going to advance. We already have advanced, and we will continue to do so.


	And of course, there’s another issue with El Salvador. We believe it’s key to maintain our fiscal discipline. We approved a fiscal responsibility law that’s very important and also a reform to our pension system. And in addition, we have worked to broaden and make more investments in the social sector. El Salvador is being consolidated as one of the most solid economic systems in Central America. This is key, because you need to be able to trust the economic system in order to get investment. And in our fight against transnational crime, El Salvador advanced in 22 points in business. It’s the highest points that we’ve had in Latin America.


	And despite what we’ve done here, logically we believe that on the issue that we’re talking about, one of the issues that’s on the agenda – and I agree with President Hernandez – is the issue of coffee. Coffee is a new possibility for the countries of the Northern Triangle. We’re all betting on national agreements to bring back the coffee industry in the Northern Triangle, which will also bring a great deal of employment, which is very important. And this is an aspect I think that we need to talk about. We need to incorporate it.


	And I want to say also that we would like to bring up the issue of security. We’ve been doing our work. Just this year we’ve gone down in 23 percent in homicides. We come from 22 per day to 9.2 homicides per day. And this is – our database is very important. El Salvador is committed to this alliance and has taken very, very important measures, having improved coordination with all of the prosecutors and law enforcement personnel in the Northern Triangle and the United States, and we have seized more drugs than ever. Just a couple of days ago, we just seized drugs from a small submarine that was carrying an enormous cargo to the United States. I think we’re doing it well. I think we need to keep strengthening these programs.


	And of course, in this area we have a profound reform of the prison system, as never before seen in our country. In – we have improved from 247 to 170 percent of overcrowding in the prisons, which seemed an issue that was impossible to solve, but we have invested in a great deal to modernize our prison system, because the issue of security is multifaceted. It’s not just one point; it’s the whole structure. And our El Salvador Seguro plan has given us clear references on the issue, and we’ve been putting the greatest of efforts into this to work with young people, with girls, with boys, with communities, with families, and to move community leadership. This is very important. But on the issue of security, basically we cannot center everything around repression, but we are doing and acting very willfully and strongly.


	We have a mechanism. We’re trying to look for the most dangerous of the heads of the gangs. Parts of them are highly criminal and in this program of the 200 most looked for, most wanted, we’ve already taken 123 out of circulation. Many of them are already in maximum security prisons, and we’ve also invested a great deal in that. But also, the level of coordination in the Northern Triangle has also gone up in exchange of information and systems and databases that allow us to coordinate and work hand-in-hand and exchange information among the police forces of the Northern Triangle, and also the armies, which the constitution allows to have limited activity within the borders of our country.


	We’ve had very defined and focalized and concrete activities, and this even led us to a discussion that we had with our counterparts in the United States, and we’ve been progressing. And there’s no doubt that we believe that in the area of security, we need to keep investing resources for three things. Prevention, first of all, because there’s no successful, sustained strategy without opportunities in the communities. Secondly, to reinforce our police forces to be more modern, effective, and that they have the best of the equipment. And we made a jump here in our commitment to create a fund, a special contribution, for equipment. And it’s been very good to give sustainability to the investments that we’re making in this area. And of course the third issue we’ve always said is in the area of security. We have to have a very clear strategy of international cooperation against transnational organized crime. That’s very hard to do by yourself, and there’s no doubt that our cooperation has been very positive and can continue to grow.


	I would like to say that we have found that this process that we have ongoing, we are the primary protagonists, the countries in the Northern Triangle. It’s very difficult for anybody else to do what we can’t do for ourselves, and as President Morales and President Hernandez said – and I completely agree – we are profoundly committed to success. It’s not easy, but it’s not impossible either if we continue to work together, and within the framework of law, which is what we’ve committed to, and respecting one another’s sovereignty, and respecting our constitutions, and respecting our own judicial frameworks. We – going – because of the frankness that we’ve talked about, I want to say clearly that there is no threat to the excellent relationship with our partner, the United States.


	We think it’s normal – we’ve just closed a partial agreement with South Korea with a free trade agreement. We think that’s important because El Salvador is one of the most open countries to the rest of the world, and so a hundred and – more than 170 countries have trade relationships with the – with El Salvador. So China is not out of the picture. It’s a constitutional decision and I believe that we have to find opportunities with everybody in the world that we have a relationship where our respect is mutual.


	And I would like to close by saying three things we will probably have to incorporate to either this agenda, but we cannot leave aside. That is – that has to do with the migration issue, and I’m not going to repeat myself because President Morales and President Hernandez have already said it categorically. We are very concerned about family reunification, especially about the young children that have remained here in the United States. The issue of TPS – we need time in the Northern Triangle, and I hope on this issue we can have a shared vision and agreement on how to face this in the short term. Because the rest of this is going to take time, it’s taking time, and that’s normal. But we think that here, we could advance towards where we are allowed – after announcement of TPS, we think we can open a new window to be able to talk about this issue again, as has been done at different levels.


	I think, secondly, it’s important to incorporate the issue – when we talk about productive issues, we need to talk about coffee, where all of us are – is interested in how to create more and better employment. And as a country, we’d like to reaffirm that we are completely convinced that this is the way forward, that in the measure to which we can share strategies, we will be opening more and better opportunities for our communities. And again, personally as representative of El Salvador – and of course, I’ve talked to the president about this – I want to say that we are completely in agreement that our relationship with the United States has to be strong and deeper all the time. Thank you.


SECRETARY POMPEO: I’ll invite remarks from Foreign Secretary Videgaray.


FOREIGN SECRETARY VIDEGARAY: (Via interpreter) Thank you, Mr. Secretary. In the name of the president of Mexico, Enrique Pena Nieto, I want to affectionately greet all of you, first of all, our host, Secretary Pompeo, who has invited us to his house here at the Department of State, and Vice President Mike Pence.


	I want to take the opportunity to publicly recognize the support which has always been present and always been clear from Vice President Pence in our – his relationship with Mexico in all of its aspects. In our recent successful negotiation of the new U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade agreement as another example of what the relationship between our countries can be, the presence and the leadership of the Vice President was an important factor to actually achieve a true success in our new North American trade agreement.


	I would like to say hello to Secretary Nielsen and I really thank you for your efforts to bring this meeting together.


	Great respect and appreciation to the president of Guatemala, Jimmy Morales; the president of Honduras, Mr. Hernandez; and the vice president of El Salvador, Oscar Ortiz; and of course for me, it’s delightful to be able to give my greetings to Alfonso Navarrete of Mexico.


	I want to express our solidarity, as everybody else has, to the people of Honduras and El Salvador because of the torrential rains and flooding. And I express our solidarity with the United States, particularly the states of the northern coast of the Gulf of Mexico because of the effects of Hurricane Michael.


	More than a year ago, in February of 2017 when the Trump administration began, we had a conversation in Mexico City in which we found very clear agreement with respect to – in order to face the challenges of security in the region, in our countries, we have to work together. We have to work together, not just the United States and Mexico, but also primarily with the brethren countries of the Northern Triangle, Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador. And secondly, we agreed at that time, as we do now, that the focus on development must be preeminent to attack the causes of migration and the illegal drug trafficking.


	That’s how we began the initiative of Mexico and the United States to begin the first instance of the conference in Miami in June of last year. And today, that we have the privilege of being here for this second instance, we have to recognize that we have progressed, that we have achieved positive progress.


	Specifically, I would like to refer to the fact that we have identified priority areas for cooperation and development in the region, and we’ve worked on several projects throughout this year and four months since the first edition of this conference. The areas that were identified as priority were first, facilitate customs and trade; secondly, regional integration and energy; and third, social development with an emphasis on health, education, and agriculture. To date, we have already carried out four projects around these axes of prosperity, especially two in energy and two in trade facilitation. We continue to work with the IDB and other regional institutions to carry out concrete projects.


	For Mexico, the cooperation with the Northern Triangle has been a priority. In addition to the efforts of this conference, I would like to say that through our Yucatan fund, we have invested – in the Pena Nieto administration, we’ve invested $53 million in projects in Honduras and El Salvador, and we are preparing additional projects in Guatemala.


	The truth is, Mr. Vice President, that most of the money that we’ve invested in the Northern Triangle is in El Salvador. So through the Mesoamerica project, we continue to make efforts, and 72 percent of the financing in Mesoamerica is with the participation of Mexico. That is 348 kilometers of the grid. I also would like to say the interconnection of the electric grid in – with integrating Central America with Mexico, plus the Mesoamerica Without Hunger project with the United Nations, where we work successfully on projects for food security in all three countries.


	Looking forward, we believe that there’s a great opportunity for energy integration not only with electricity but also with natural gas, and Mexico has projects that are in process. And secondly, we believe that it is fundamental to cooperate in projects for – to promote resilience for climate problems like volcanos and earthquakes, and of course, more participation of communities in the projects. That is to say, not just huge projects but also projects that can have practical results in communities.


	In Mexico we’ve had an election in – on July 1st of this year and, as everyone knows, we will have a new president starting on December 1st, that is Andres Lopez Obrador. And I want to thank Marcelo Ebrard, who has sent a collaborator of his to assist this conference, and I celebrate as a Mexican citizen the emphasis that Lopez Obrador and his transition team have placed on the issue of shared development with the Northern Triangle as a central strategy to fight organized crime and to make migratory flows more regular.


	Mexico is no longer the principal point of origin of migrants to the United States. It’s become a transit country, which means that Mexico has new challenges which it assumes, and one of the principal ones is human rights. That is, to treat migrants from the Northern Triangle with all of the dignity and the human rights that they deserve. We also work with the Northern Triangle through the mechanism of Tricamex to defend the dignity and human rights of those countries. And I just have to add my voice to what President Hernandez said about the reunification of the children who were left at the border by their parents.


	In addition, I’d like to echo the concern in the region about migratory flows, result of the deep crisis in Venezuela. We also see with concern the situation in Nicaragua. The challenge of security at the end of the day is a challenge that only working in a coordinated fashion we’ll be able to overcome. If we work in a – if we work in a fragmented way, we will be giving a strategic advantage to organized crime.


	I’d like to recognize the work of the United States and for its – also for its willingness to cooperate, and their commitment with the countries of the Northern Triangle. Working for orderly and regular migration at the same time with security in the region will require that we continue to work as we’ve done before, working as a team.


	Thank you so much for being part of this conference, three countries of the Northern Triangle, and thank you, the United States, for being our hosts.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Thank you. Thank you, Foreign Secretary Videgaray, and thank you very much, everyone, for your remarks. I’d like to ask everyone to take five minutes to allow the press to depart and then we’ll prepare the room for the next session. Thank you, everyone, very much.

	This year marks 225 years since the United States opened a consulate in Curacao. A U.S. Consul designed the Queen Emma Bridge in Willemstad, which remains a strong symbol of our friendship as we continue to build a safe and more secure future for the Caribbean, foster entrepreneurship, and combat transnational crime.


	As you honor Curacao’s culture and proud heritage, the United States stands with you. I extend warmest wishes for the year ahead, reflecting on our shared history and looking forward to strengthening U.S.-Curacao bridges into the future.

	Authorities in Belgium announced yesterday the extradition of Asadollah Assadi, an Iranian official working under diplomatic cover, from Germany for his role in the disrupted Iranian terrorist plot to bomb a political rally near Paris, France on June 30. The scale of this plot, which involved arrests of numerous suspects across Europe – including in Belgium, France, and Germany – reminds us that Iran remains the world’s leading state sponsor of terrorism. This plot also lays bare Iran’s continued support of terrorism throughout Europe. We support our European allies in exposing and countering the threat that Iranian-backed terrorism poses around the world. The United States will continue working with our partners and allies to confront the threat posed by the Iranian regime.

SECRETARY POMPEO: Tom, thank you for the kind introduction. Catherine, it’s great to see you. Catherine Herridge is my favorite reporter, but you should know that’s a low bar. (Laughter.) I --


MS HERRIDGE: You were my favorite congressman. (Laughter.)


SECRETARY POMPEO: I – (laughter). Fair enough. (Applause.) Catherine is not only a very talented reporter but an incredibly capable woman, and she and her husband are good friends of Susan and mine. So thank you, thank you for being part of this event tonight.


	Tom, those were very kind remarks. Jefferson and Madison, Pompeo – it doesn’t quite roll off the tongue. (Laughter.) But one can always live in hope.


	I was also reminded when you said that I’m the 70th Secretary of State, and reminded that there’s only 45 presidents, so that means there’s a lot more turnover in my job than in his, and so I’m going to enjoy the moment. (Laughter.)


	Thank you to Dr. Makovsky for having me here tonight, and thank you, everyone at JINSA, for this award. I want to accept it on behalf of the entire diplomatic corps, the entire United States State Department. And I’ll also accept it as a challenge to keep my foot on the gas at the Department of State. (Applause.)


	I see a lot of friends here tonight, and I know you all have had a long day, but it is worth recounting what we’ve done in this administration over the first now coming on 20 months. Let me start with just a basic fact: In the entire Middle East, there is only one consistently pro-American, free-enterprise, democratic nation; it’s the people of the State of Israel. And this administration understands that deeply. (Applause.)


	For the previous eight years, we had an administration that showed more respect to the leaders of Iran than to the people of Israel.


	President Obama thought he – thought if he made dangerous concessions, removed economic sanctions, and flew a plane full of cash to Tehran, he could somehow hug Iran’s leaders into behaving well and rejoining the community of nations.


	But those leaders aren’t from a Disney movie. They’re real. They’re not tragically misunderstood. They are murderers and funders of terrorism who lead chants – today, still – of “Death to America.” Their goals include profiting off the misery of their own people and wiping Israel off the face of the Earth.


	By and large, I think the American people understand the threat that Iran poses. It’s why they opposed the deal that the previous administration made by a margin of two to one, and it’s why they sent to our country a very different kind of president in 2016.


	Today, after just under two years, there’s a long list. Tom talked about some of them. But it’s worthy of just grinding through real fast because the magnitude of the change is extraordinary.


	Tom mentioned the move of the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem and recognized Jerusalem as Israel’s capital. Common sense, I think.


	He pulled out of the JCPOA and imposed some of the harshest sanctions in history on the regime in Iran to change its behavior, and more are to follow.


	He supported the commitment of the largest-ever security support of $3.8 billion annually.


	And he took a stand against anti-Semitism on the world stage by withdrawing from the U.N. Human Rights Council.


	We have also exposed Hamas for what it really is, and we are making a truly historic push for peace between Israel and the Palestinians.


	The bottom line? I think – I actually had the privilege to speak with Prime Minister Netanyahu today on a couple of issues of the moment, and we were talking about things a little more broadly, and it reminds me that the bottom line is that the U.S.-Israel relationship is stronger today than it has been ever. And that’s good. (Applause.) And that’s good for – it’s good for both countries. And I want to talk for just a minute, and then I’m going to take a few questions. I want to talk about the challenges that Iran is presenting to Israel, to America, and, indeed, to the world.


	Iran has seen this instability in Syria as a golden opportunity to tip the scales. Its goals have included expanding the reach of its Revolutionary Guard, gaining an entrenched position near the Golan Heights, and, ultimately, establishing a second front from which proxies like Hizballah can terrorize the Israeli people.


	Today the Syrian conflict is reaching a new juncture. Assad has tightened his grip thanks to Russia, Iran, and other regional actors.


	ISIS, though not completely snuffed out, has been beaten into a shadow of its former self. And these changing circumstances have required the reassessment of America’s mission in Syria. Defeating ISIS, which was once our primary focus, continues to be a top priority, but it will now be joined by two other mutually reinforcing objectives. These include a peaceful and political resolution to the Syrian conflict and the removal of all Iranian and Iranian-backed forces from Syria. (Applause.)


	Under President Trump’s leadership, the Department of State has been now engaged in a months-long diplomatic process aimed at making headway on each of these three strategic objectives.


	Last month at the U.N. General Assembly in New York, I expressed our full support for U.N. Security Council Resolution 2254, which sets a political process for ending this conflict in Syria. And we’re urging every nation to support it.


	At the UN we were also encouraged to find increasing international consensus that Iran and its proxies must not be allowed to maintain a foothold in Syria. The onus for expelling Iran from the country falls on the Syrian Government, which bears responsibility for its presence there.


	We’ve been clear: if Syria doesn’t ensure the total withdrawal of Iranian-backed troops, it will not seek – not receive one single dollar from the United States for reconstruction.


	Our efforts at the U.N. were just a small public window into our efforts. I’ve named a team. Spearheading our effort is Special Representative Jim Jeffrey. Many of you would know him. Nobody understands the web of regional interests and the political complexities better than he does. His resume includes ambassadorships in Albania, in Turkey, and Iraq, among much other parts of his storied career in diplomacy.


	Meanwhile, to coordinate our efforts on Iran, I’ve asked Brian Hook to lead our Iran Action Group. We are leading a historic international campaign to apply diplomatic and economic pressure against the Islamic Republic of Iran. Our goal is simple, is to cut off the revenues the regime uses to spread terror and chaos, to fund its nuclear programs, and line its own pockets with money that should be given to the Iranian people.


	The State Department’s diplomacy itself is just one part of our interagency effort all across this administration.


	Underlying this approach is President Trump’s unwavering belief that Israel – like all nations – has the right to defend its own sovereignty. (Applause.) That means we’ll continue to stand up for its right to target Iranian-backed militias within Syria for as long as that threat remains.


	Now, I want to leave plenty of time for discussion, so let me close with just one last thought.


	Israel is everything we want the entire Middle East to look like going forward.


	It is democratic and prosperous. It desires peace. And it is a home to a free press and a thriving free market economy.


	Compare that to Iran, whose corrupt leaders assault the human rights of their own people, finance terrorism, and undermine U.S. interests in every corner of the Middle East.


	Rarely in world affairs is the contrast between two sides so stark.


	Under President Trump’s leadership, the United States is standing where it should firmly be: on the side of Israel. (Applause.)


	I want to close by again thanking you all for being here. To get an award that was named after Scoop Jackson is truly meaningful to me, as an amateur historian, and I think important for the Department of State to recognize the good work that it is doing. I will have the opportunity tomorrow to share this with each and every one of the folks who works for me.


	Thank you all so very much. I look forward to a few questions. (Applause.)


DR MAKOVSKY: All right. I want to thank you very – everybody hear me all right? Okay. I want to thank you very much again, Secretary Pompeo. And as we said earlier this evening, the efforts of yourself, the President, and the rest of the administration has certainly made America stronger, and made Israel stronger, and we just really – we all applaud it and commend it. So thank you very much. I want to just thank you again. (Applause.)


SECRETARY POMPEO: Thank you. Thank you all.


DR MAKOVSKY: I want to ask the first question about Iran. You mentioned you – the administration, to their credit, is – you’re imposing the toughest sanctions, re-imposing the sanctions, but imposing them in a very tough way, commendably.


	Let me ask you that – at JINSA, we propose a range of ways of broadening the policy or a range of other policies. I just wanted to raise it with you, and I wanted to get your thoughts about that or other policies that you might be thinking about in ways that pressure the Iranians. For instance, interdicting arms shipments from Iran to Syria and Yemen, whether the United States could be more active in that. Giving Israel more tools – given that Israel is on the front lines, giving Israel more tools to confront the Iranians, and in a likely future war, such as by frontloading the 10-year MOU which just kicked in on defense aid. Supporting Syrian Kurdish – either strong autonomy or independence and offering to protect them. They’re our allies with ISIS, and also – but to do that also is a way to prevent the Iranian-backed Assad regime from reclaiming control over the whole thing.


	And lastly, I would say pursuing a policy of – to use an old 1950s term – of rollback of the Iranians. And I – these are some ideas that, among others, that we’ve raised at JINSA, and I was curious if you’ve considered some of these or others. We’d love to hear other ways that the State Department and the administration might be considering of pressuring the Iranians.


SECRETARY POMPEO: So the sanctions get a lot of the headlines. The policy that President Trump has put in place is much broader than that. I can’t go into all the details on each of those. We don’t have time for all of that. But there’s a lot of work being done on interdiction. You don’t see it all, it’s not very noisy; I did some of it in my former job. It’s a full range of things to do the simple task of convincing the Iranian leaders to behave like a normal nation.


	I listed 12 things that the Iranians have to do for us to get back in a relationship with them, and when you read through them they’re nothing more than what we ask Belgium to do, right? Like stop launching rockets into major international airports, for starters. It’s really – it seemed daunting, but at the end of the day, just be it. Just be a normal country. But it’s not just sanctions.


	So five capitals, right? Beirut, Damascus, Sanaa, Tehran itself, and Baghdad. Those are the pressure points. That’s the dream of the Islamic Republic for hegemony and we are pushing back in each of those capitals, in each of those places, with every tool available to the United States Government to achieve that goal: to get the Iranian regime to behave like a normal nation.


DR MAKOVSKY: Okay. You want to address those others or I’ll just move on to the next question?


SECRETARY POMPEO: I’ll come back to them.


DR MAKOVSKY: Yeah, okay, sure. The other suggestion was – it was about how – ways we can help Israel further and also what our policy is about the Syrian Kurds who have been our allies with the – against ISIS and so on.


SECRETARY POMPEO: So look, we’ve worked closely with the Syrian Kurds now for my entire time in service in this administration. They have been great partners. We are now driving to make sure that they have a seat at the table. The political process that I referred, the hardest part, the reason it hasn’t made progress is because we’ve demanded that every element in Syria gets an opportunity to be part of that future government, and in the absence of that and in the absence of their representation, we won’t participate in what will be a big check that someone’s going to have to write to fix the situation in Syria, and the Syrian Kurds will surely be part of that.


DR MAKOVSKY: And how would you define the administration’s overall objective? I used the term “rollback” which doesn’t – “containment” was maybe the policy perhaps – perhaps at times of the previous administration, but how would you define, if you had to think of a couple words to define the objectives we have towards Iran?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Yeah. I mean, I don’t know how else to say it. We won’t be settled until we have solved each of the files adequately, right? A permanent solution to ensure that Iran never has the capacity to have a nuclear weapon for all time, in any form. (Applause.) And second – second – to push back against this terror regime which is not only taking place in Iraq and in Syria and in Lebanon, but in European capitals, around the world. It’s remarkable and we – I hope we can get more support from our European partners of this effort. I’m convinced that we will over time.


	And then, finally, I’ll put the other bucket, the broader set of Iranian malign activity – there’s much of it – and that’s the mission statement. I don’t know how to put it into three or four words, but it’s to take each of those three spaces and ensure that Iran ceases its current activity which is so fundamentally detrimental to the world and, frankly, very detrimental to Iran’s own people.


DR MAKOVSKY: Okay. I want to ask you about Turkey. Not really, unless you want to raise it, about what’s been in the news in the last few days with the Saudi consulate there. I actually want to ask you a different question about Turkey.


	There are two things. One is: Would a sale of our F-35s to Turkey proceed if Turkey takes delivery of Russian S – of S-400s? That was the first one.


SECRETARY POMPEO: So I can’t answer that question. I don’t want to get out in front of the President on this. But there are a whole series of actions that we’re asking Turkey to do. They are a NATO partner. We need them to participate in the enforcement of the norms that NATO has put forward with its mission statement, and we’ve asked Turkey to do that in every dimension. And we’re very – we’re disappointed in their behavior to date, but we’re hopeful that over time, they’ll begin to do things that make more sense not only for the Middle East, but for the world. They have the capacity for good. It’s a big country that sits at the fulcrum between the Middle East and Europe, and we are applying every element of our diplomatic capacity to convince Turkey that being part of the West is the future for the Turkish people.


DR MAKOVSKY: The President has made, correctly, a big issue out of the fact of the American pastor Andrew Brunson being imprisoned for two years on patently false charges. His next court hearing is in two days.


SECRETARY POMPEO: In about 30 hours, yes.


DR MAKOVSKY: Yeah, is on – his next court hearing is on – in two days on October 12th. How would his release affect, do you think, overall U.S.-Turkey relations?


SECRETARY POMPEO: It’s an important step, but make no mistake about it, they shouldn’t have held him for all of this time. But look, it’s a good thing, it’s the right thing for them to do, it’s the humanitarian thing for Turkey to do, and I’m very hopeful that before too long, Pastor Brunson will – he and his wife will be able to return to the United States. President Trump has had a focus on it, the administration’s had a focus on it, and we’re very hopeful that we’ll see a good outcome before too long.


DR MAKOVSKY: Thank you. My last question is about the Palestinian Authority. Now, as Senator Cotton mentioned also about the Taylor Force Act – and this is something that JINSA and our fellow, Sander Gerber in particular, particularly championed and focused on.


	However, since the passage of Taylor Force earlier this year, the Palestinian Authority has not really altered its policies or laws in paying terrorists and families. And I had a – what do you think this says about the Palestinian Authority? Do you consider it an entity that sponsors terror, for instance? What does it say about the prospects for peace and just generally about the U.S. approach to the Palestinians?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Well, I actually signed a memo today with respect to the Taylor Force Act denying $165 million that would have been appropriated to the Palestinian Authority. (Applause.) That number is a rough estimate of the amount of money that was paid out on – for the various violations the Taylor Force Act was designed to enforce.


	But you’re right, the behavior has not changed materially, and this administration has taken, much as it did with the embassy, has taken a historic approach. It has said to the Palestinians we very much want you to have a space, you need to govern, you need to decide you want peace as well. We said the same thing to the Palestinians both in the West Bank and in the Gaza Strip. We’ve not rolled out our plan for the Middle East peace process yet, but we will before too terribly long, and we are hopeful that there will be parties on all sides that are prepared to engage in a constructive conversation that will lead to that.


	We are very hopeful that one day the Palestinian people will have the same kinds of things, the same material, the same opportunities that the people of Israel have, right? A real economy, a real governance, all the things that we want for every citizen of the world. And whether it’s the Hamas leaders in the Gaza Strip or the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank, we’ve not been able to make that happen yet. But this administration has taken a fundamentally different view of how it is we can ultimately achieve that end objective.


DR MAKOVSKY: I just want to conclude. I know you’ve had a little busy travel schedule lately and I just want to thank you again and the whole administration for everything you’ve been doing, again, for U.S. national security and for the U.S.-Israel security relationship. We really appreciate it very much and thank you very much.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Thank you very much, Mike. Thank you all. (Applause.)

	In order to conduct U.S. foreign policy, the State Department needs its full team in place. Today, there are more than 60 State Department nominees awaiting confirmation in the United States Senate. That's more than a quarter of all the senior-level confirmable positions at the Department. These are excellent candidates, a mix of career Foreign Service Officers and political nominees. More than a dozen of these qualified political nominees are being held up by Senate Democrats because of politics.


	We’ve done our part at the State Department by putting forward a slate of candidates. It’s Senator Bob Menendez and his colleagues who have refused to vote on these nominees, putting our nation at risk.


	Yesterday, astonishingly and shamefully, Senator Menendez blamed the Administration for a lack of confirmed nominees when he said, “This Administration’s continued inability to adequately or appropriately fill key national security positions puts our nation at risk.”


	These outstanding candidates remain unconfirmed because Senator Menendez and some of his colleagues are using our nominees as a political football. This is unacceptable. The “risk” to the nation lies at the feet of Senator Menendez. We need our team on the field to conduct America’s foreign policy, and today I call on the Senator and his colleagues to stop this delay and obstruction now.

	Today, oral proceedings before the International Court of Justice (ICJ) began in The Hague in a case brought by Iran against the United States, Certain Iranian Assets. As I have stated previously, Iran’s filings before the ICJ are a misuse of the Court for political and propaganda purposes. Iran brought this case in 2016 to challenge measures the United States adopted to deter Iran’s support for terrorist attacks against the United States and others, as well as to respond to other internationally destabilizing actions taken by Iran. These measures include allowing victims of terrorism to recover damages from Iran and Iranian entities in U.S. courts. The actions at the root of this case, among many others, involve the Iran-sponsored bombing of the U.S. Marine Barracks in Beirut, Lebanon in 1983, which killed 241 U.S. peacekeepers.


	We owe it to our fallen heroes, their families, and the victims of Iran’s terrorist activities to vigorously defend against the Iranian regime’s meritless claims this week in The Hague, where we will show that Iran’s case should be dismissed.


	We will continue to fight against the scourge of Iran’s terrorist activities in all venues and will continue to increase the pressure on this outlaw state. These malign activities by Iran are among the reasons we decided last week to terminate the 1955 U.S.-Iran Treaty of Amity. We hope that Iran’s leaders will come to recognize that the only way to ensure a positive future for their country is by ceasing their campaign of terror and destruction around the world.

POLITBURO MEMBER YANG: (Translated) (Inaudible) have the opportunity today to have frank and in-depth communication with you on China-U.S. relations and other issues.


	At present, the China-U.S. relationship is at a critical juncture, facing many challenges. China has made solemn representations on a series of negative words and deeds recently made by the United States, and we have stated our principles and position publicly. China will continue to take the necessary measures to firmly safeguard its own interests.


	As two big countries, China and the United States can only achieve win-win through cooperation. Both sides should and must make the right choice. We hope the United States and China can meet each other halfway and conscientiously implement the important consensus reached by the leaders of the two countries at their multiple meetings. [We should] properly manage and control differences on the basis of mutual respect, and expand pragmatic cooperation on the basis of mutual benefit and reciprocity, so as to ensure that Sino-U.S. relationship can move forward on the right way.


	Thank you.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Director Yang, it’s good to see you. Thank you for hosting me today. I appreciate it. I look forward to a good conversation. As you said, there are many issues, places where we have disagreements, and it is worthy and important that we listen to each other and work through them to find constructive solutions so that we can get a good outcome for the two of our countries.


	I’m pleased to share with you the work that I did this past couple of days on the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, but I look forward to talking about the broad range of issues that impact our two countries and the people of our two nations, and I look forward to a good, candid, constructive conversation with you today.

FOREIGN MINISTER WANG: (Translated) Mr. Secretary proposed a visit to China. We are willing to meet with you. Recently, as the United States continuously escalates trade frictions with China, it has also taken a series of actions that undermine China’s rights and interests regarding Taiwan and other issues, and made groundless accusations against China’s domestic and foreign policies. We believe such practice directly impacts our mutual trust. It casts a shadow over the prospects of China-U.S. relations and completely runs against the interests of the peoples of both countries.


	We ask the United States to stop these kinds of erroneous practices. We believe that China and the United States should keep adhering to the right path of cooperation and win-win, rather than falling into the wrong path of conflict and confrontation.


	I know that the Secretary, during this visit also very much wants to exchange views with us on the Korean Peninsula nuclear issue, among other regional hotspot issues. This just shows that as two big countries, two permanent members of the Security Council, we indeed need and should strengthen communication and cooperation to assume the responsibilities entrusted to us by the international community. Certainly, such cooperation should be supported by a healthy and stable bilateral relationship. I hope that Mr. Secretary’s visit to Beijing this time will play a positive role in achieving this goal. That’s all for me for now, please.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Thank you, Foreign Minister Wang. Thank you for welcoming me to Beijing. I did indeed want to come here to have discussions (inaudible) the issues that you’ve characterized we have a fundamental disagreement. We have grave concerns about the actions that China has taken, and I look forward to having the opportunity to discuss each of those today because this is an incredibly important relationship.


	I do want to share with you my visit with Chairman Kim Jong-un yesterday and the progress we’ve made, and to make sure that we are working together on our joint mission that we’ve talked about before: the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. So I know we’ll have good, candid, frank conversations with respect to that issue and the broader set of relations between our two countries.


	I regret that the Strategic Dialogue between our two countries was something that you all chose not to undertake. It would have been an important opportunity for us to have a discussion about these longer-term, important issues that present opportunities for the people of our two countries.


	So thank you for hosting me today. I look forward to our conversation.

QUESTION: So how close are you guys on the logistics for a second summit?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Pretty close.


QUESTION: Like, so an announcement should be --


SECRETARY POMPEO: Hard to know. Hard to know. Sometimes that last issue is hard to close. But we’re getting pretty close. Yeah.


QUESTION: Okay. You want to --


SECRETARY POMPEO: And most importantly, both the leaders believe there’s real progress that can be made, substantive progress that can be made at the next summit, and so we’re going to get it at a time that works for each of the two leaders in a place that works for both of them. We’re not quite there yet, but we’ll get there.


QUESTION: Are you at a point, though, where you think it needs the top – in other words, you could – you’re not going to – it’s not – you’re not in a position now to be able to get that done? It’s got to go to the very highest level? Is that where we are?


SECRETARY POMPEO: So a couple things that came out of this. One is – and I’ll let Steve maybe make a comment here too – we will be – what’s the right way? We will be having more frequent and higher-level working group discussions than we’ve had in some time on a set of issues. So that was important good news. I think Steve’s counterpart will be Choe Son-hui. And we think – we think that’s important too. So we’ll have a chance to meet here in between the summit date as well. So we really hope we can deliver some good outcomes when the summit takes place. But we do think, right, this is a place where, ultimately, some of these big, difficult issues have to be resolved by the nations’ most senior leaders, and we’re hoping to have those presented in a way that the two leaders can resolve them when they get together.


QUESTION: All right. Last one from me. But is this kind of like the Vienna invitation that you – in your statement from --


SECRETARY POMPEO: Yeah, it’s consistent with what we were seeking to do there.


QUESTION: But not necessarily Vienna for --


SECRETARY POMPEO: Who knows.


QUESTION: No, not for the summit, but I mean --


SECRETARY POMPEO: Yeah. No, no, I’m – that’s what I’m saying. I don’t know where those – I mean, Steve, you want to say anything about it? Yeah.


MR BIEGUN: Sure. Good morning. The – so last night I issued an invitation to my counterpart to meet as soon as possible. We’re actually working on specific dates and location, and I was reassured to see today in the KCNA statement that the DPRK likewise has fully endorsed the idea that working-level talks will begin as soon as possible. So talks for the sake of talks, obviously, are no great accomplishment, but we actually have a full range of issues now to talk about too. When you combine the commitments that came out of the joint statement between the North and South in – from the Pyongyang summit as well as the issues that Secretary of State Pompeo and Chairman Kim discussed yesterday, we’re starting to see a first wave of actions we can take on all four pillars of the Singapore communique, for sure, but that’s specifically on the issue of denuclearization as well. So we’re very much looking forward to that.


	Some of that is actually not even going to be about the threshold question of whether we can do this. It’s more the modalities of how we do this, and we’re looking forward very quickly to work that out with our DPRK counterparts, and really begin in earnest the process of denuclearization to fill the vision the President and Chairman Kim had from Singapore.


QUESTION: Can I ask a quick follow-up on the Trump-Kim summit? Will – are you guys ruling out Pyongyang as a location for that? I ask because North Koreans yesterday mentioned that to me as a place they’d like to see it happen. And will it happen in the next month?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Can’t answer either of those questions.


QUESTION: No? Okay. And then I guess a follow-up on the statement that Heather put out last night. Do you guys have a date for when international nuclear inspectors will be allowed onto the Punggye-ri location?


SECRETARY POMPEO: As soon as we get it logistically worked out, Chairman Kim said he’s ready to – ready to allow them to come in, and there’s a lot of logistics that will be required to execute that, but when we get them we’ll put them on the ground.


QUESTION: And in terms of forward movement on the summit between Moon and Kim Jong-un, they agreed that international inspectors would be allowed onto the – which one was it?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Punggye-ri. Yeah. And the missile engine test site.


QUESTION: Yes.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Yes.


QUESTION: So --


SECRETARY POMPEO: So we’re hopeful that’ll occur as well.


QUESTION: The Yongbyon site?


SECRETARY POMPEO: You need to go back and reread. You --


QUESTION: No, they said international inspectors would be allowed into the Yongbyon site if the U.S. took corresponding measures.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Fair enough. Yeah.


QUESTION: So is there any forward movement on that?


SECRETARY POMPEO: We don’t have any comment on the – again, we’re not going to talk about where we are in these negotiations except for things we have agreed to release with the North Koreans.


QUESTION: Okay.


QUESTION: Could I ask you, Mr. Secretary, you mentioned you would bring up the abductee issue with Chairman Kim. Is --


SECRETARY POMPEO: Yep. We – we raise third-country issues each time we travel. The importance of making sure that we resolve all the issues, right – one of the key pillars of the statement between Chairman Kim and President Trump was that we would have better relationships, confidence-building measures. We would fundamentally change the nature of North Korea’s relationship with the rest of the world. And so there are many issues, including the abductee issue, that will need to be addressed in order to achieve that. And I think Chairman Kim understands that fully.


QUESTION: A follow-up on some of the questions about inspectors. Has it been decided which organization is going to --


SECRETARY POMPEO: I don’t have any comment on that.


QUESTION: Who is the counterpart? I’m sorry, maybe I missed it. Who is going to --


MR BIEGUN: Well, we – this is all completely up to the North Koreans. They decide who sits across the table from us, but we have reason to believe it’ll be Choe Son-hui, the vice minister of foreign affairs.


QUESTION: Who is a known quantity?


MR BIEGUN: Mm-hmm, a very experienced negotiator, well known to our side, and somebody who we think can deliver good results for Chairman Kim and President Trump both.


QUESTION: I’m sorry, she was not there yesterday?


MR BIEGUN: No.


QUESTION: Okay.


MS NAUERT: We’re heading to China today. Any questions about that?


	Does anybody have anything on China?


QUESTION: Are you planning to meet with Xi Jinping?


SECRETARY POMPEO: No, I won’t be meeting with him today. I’ll be meeting with my two counterparts, Wang Yi, the foreign minister, and Yang Jiechi.


QUESTION: And do you expect them to raise the full gamut of their unhappiness with the administration, or is this just going to be a North Korea thing?


SECRETARY POMPEO: No, it’ll be a much broader discussion than that. I expect they’ll also raise the issues that they’re happy with – lots of places we find overlap in our interests as well – and we’ll explore all the places we’re working well together and all the concerns that each country has.


QUESTION: Are you worried about the Chinese and Russians’ meeting with North Korea in any way hurting the advancement that you can make in your discussions with North Korea?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Chairman Kim was very clear yesterday in our conversation about the things that we need to do between the United States and the DPRK. That’s what we’re focused on.


QUESTION: And ahead of your meeting with Prime Minister Abe, you spoke about wanting to synchronize the countries on the situation in North Korea. Have – in the last two days, I mean, have you found that the U.S, South Korea, and Japan are on the same page or are there areas of concern or disagreement that you’re encountering?


SECRETARY POMPEO: I’ve never been involved in an international discussion where there weren’t differences of view, not only between governments but inside of governments, lots of thoughts. But if you look at the approach, we are in lockstep with each of those two countries in terms of how we approach achieving the results that everyone is aimed at. And so there’ll be tactical places where we’ll have debate and disagreement. That is a necessary component of getting to the best deliverable. But with respect to our relationships with the Republic of Korea and Japan on this issue, I have found that we are in lockstep on the most important issues and how to approach them.


QUESTION: I saw a couple of Japanese officials last night, so have you already briefed them?


MR BIEGUN: I did.


QUESTION: You did. And some officials were expecting that most likely you would fly back to Tokyo.


MR BIEGUN: Well, we’re moving on to Beijing, and from there we’re flying directly back to Washington, D.C. I’ve made a point to both our South Korean and our Japanese allies that I will be available before and after every discussion so that we’re in complete alignment and have full transparency between us on the discussions. Just for scheduling purposes, the Japanese – my Japanese counterparts were kind enough to fly here yesterday evening, and we had a late-night meeting where we went through the full gamut of discussions so that we can achieve exactly what the Secretary said, which is we stay on the same page on the big, important issues, and we are.


SECRETARY POMPEO: I should mention, so you can see from Steve’s first trip with me to Pyongyang and the work that he’s done already in advance of this, he is going to be at the very center of not only managing the relationship with North Korea and achieving the ends we are, but also making sure that we’re working with not only with the Republic of Korea and Japan, but there are many countries that have a deep interest – China, others.


QUESTION: Russia.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Russia – that have deep interests in this set of issues. And Steve is going to take the responsibility to be working directly for me as the point person, making sure that we are communicating well, fully coordinated, we’re taking on information from them so that we don’t have disconnects between our allies and others with interests in making sure that denuclearization proceeds as quickly as possible.


QUESTION: It sounds like not very much sleep for you in the next couple months.


MR BIEGUN: He’s the boss.


QUESTION: Critics are going to say you guys came here, you didn’t accomplish anything new on denuclearization itself. What’s your response to that? Did you just come to set up the Trump-Kim summit?


SECRETARY POMPEO: On the process we made significant progress, we’ll continue to make significant process, and we are further along in making that progress than any administration in an awfully long time.

QUESTION: So earlier this week you spoke about making deeper progress --


SECRETARY POMPEO: Yep.


QUESTION: -- on the path towards denuclearization with North Korea this week, on this trip.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Yep.


QUESTION: So what does that mean? How can North Koreans convince you that they are motivated and devoted to making deeper progress on this trip?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Yeah, so I’m not going to talk about specific negotiating positions that both sides are taking in the conversation. Here’s the objective in broad strokes.


QUESTION: Yeah.


SECRETARY POMPEO: There have been many exchanges, exchanges at the level between the chairman and the President, exchanges that I’ve had with my counterparts, exchanges at the working level, some of this with the South Koreans, so lots of conversations. That’s the senior meetings. The mission is to make sure that we understand what each side is truly trying to achieve.


QUESTION: Yeah.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Right. We know the end state. It was set out in the Singapore summit, four elements of it. So we know that piece of what we’re trying to achieve. But how it is each side is seeking to approach that and how we can deliver against the commitments that were made.


	And so there are lots of requirements for this. Each side has to develop sufficient trust so they can take the actions necessary to get to the end, and then we’re also going to set up the next summit. So we hope to at least – I doubt we’ll get it nailed, but begin to develop options for both location and timing that Chairman Kim will meet with the President again. Maybe we’ll get further than that. But he’s got to --


QUESTION: So you don’t have a date, a location?


SECRETARY POMPEO: There’s no date or location yet set.


QUESTION: But after this trip, is it possible that you’ll have that?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Yes.


QUESTION: Okay.


SECRETARY POMPEO: But I would guess there’ll still be confirmation to do. There’s complex scheduling, logistics issues --


QUESTION: Yeah.


SECRETARY POMPEO: -- that we won’t be able to resolve in the hours that we’re on the ground.


QUESTION: But a general date, a general location?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Hope so. Hope so.


QUESTION: Okay.


SECRETARY POMPEO: We may not, but I think we will. We probably won’t announce it, right. I know everybody wants to know, but negotiations don’t take place in public.


QUESTION: But that’s not a negotiation. I mean, that’s a decision.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Sure, it is. Sure, it is. We’re having conversations, moving conversations about how to achieve denuclearization. Every element of that – all the timing issues, the venue issues, those things all are material to delivering this fundamental transition between hostility on the peninsula and peace and well-being for the North Korean people. This is 70 years on, so every single piece of this is material to delivering against it.


QUESTION: When you talk about building trust, is the U.S. willing to make some moves to show that they are still building that trust?


SECRETARY POMPEO: We’ve done that. What do you mean, are we willing?


QUESTION: Additional. Additional.


SECRETARY POMPEO: What do you mean, are we willing? I mean, you ask that question in an odd way.


QUESTION: Well, what I mean is they’ve been asking for a declaration to end the Korean War, so I’m wondering if you’re willing to show that you trust them by offering that and --


SECRETARY POMPEO: Again, I’m not going to talk about any of the particulars of the negotiation.


QUESTION: Okay. So South Korea basically said that on this trip you should not press for an inventory of North Korea’s nuclear programs --


SECRETARY POMPEO: I understand, but --


QUESTION: -- because it would risk bogging down negotiations.


SECRETARY POMPEO: I’m not going to talk about any of the elements of the negotiations.


QUESTION: Okay. Are you bringing any letters, messages, presents from President Trump to Kim Jong-un?


SECRETARY POMPEO: I’m not bringing anything that we’re prepared at this point to talk about publicly.


QUESTION: Okay. So no message from the President to Kim Jong-un?


SECRETARY POMPEO: The President said his message to Chairman Kim.


QUESTION: I don’t know, there have been letters back and forth.


SECRETARY POMPEO: But he said it. He spoke at UNGA about this at great length.


QUESTION: Okay, all right.


SECRETARY POMPEO: And so yes, I’ve obviously got a message. The President has tasked me and our State Department team to deliver the outcomes from Singapore and to begin to find the – look, you have to remember the history. This is not the first team that’s gone to try and accomplish this. There have been comprehensive agreements reached between the parties before.


QUESTION: Right.


SECRETARY POMPEO: And they foundered. They didn’t work. And so this has to be fundamentally different from that. I believe what Chairman Kim and the President agreed to is fundamentally different. It’s this idea that we will get to denuclearization in a fully verified, irreversible way and then we will actually deliver on the commitments to make this brighter future for the North Korean people.


	And I think Chairman Kim too, that’s – when I’ve spoken to him, when I’ve heard the President speak to him, when I’ve seen his public remarks, he’s given every indication that that’s his intention too, that he understands that this is the right thing for North Korea and that this is the – that he wants to be part of delivering this great outcome for his people.


QUESTION: North Korea has a delegation they just announced yesterday going this week to Russia and to China, and then also having a meeting with Russia and China led by the vice foreign minister. What’s your reaction to that?


SECRETARY POMPEO: So we talk with Choe Son-hui all the time. We know her as well. We know that China is going to be part of the solution. They’ll ultimately be – when we get to the end, we will have signed a peace – if we do this well, we will have signed a peace treaty that ends the armistice, and China will be part of that. We welcome China’s efforts to continue to enforce the UN Security Council resolutions. We’ve talked with them about that a great deal. We value their participation in this process, and so I think it’s inevitable that the North Koreans are going to talk to their longtime neighbor, the Chinese.


QUESTION: It won’t jeopardize what you can accomplish if they don’t have everyone from the North Korean side at the table with the U.S. delegation?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Chairman Kim is going to be there.


QUESTION: Okay. And then China.


SECRETARY POMPEO: And by the way, she may be back.


QUESTION: She might be, yeah.


SECRETARY POMPEO: She might be back.


QUESTION: Right.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Yeah.


QUESTION: I mean, they haven’t said when she’s coming back, so --


SECRETARY POMPEO: Chairman Kim – we anticipate that Chairman Kim will be there to participate and that Kim Yong-chol will be there.


QUESTION: Do you hope she’ll come back?


SECRETARY POMPEO: These are the two senior leaders. It’s up to Chairman Kim who he puts in front of us to negotiate with him to work with him on the solution.


QUESTION: And then with regard to China, given the increasing tensions, the Vice President’s speech yesterday saying China is carrying out a campaign to undermine President Trump – how much more challenging does that make your conversations with Chinese officials on North Korea this week?


SECRETARY POMPEO: My conversations with the Chinese have consistently – they’ve made clear that this issue of the denuclearization of North Korea is important to them, that they want this to be successful. And they have said in spite of places where we have disagreements in other things – we’ve had disagreements on trade and the like – that they are determined to support our efforts to see this through to its completion, consistently since we first began this process.


QUESTION: Do you know who you’ll meet in China yet?


SECRETARY POMPEO: I don’t know that the meetings are set. I don’t know that the – that my interlocutors – and if it’s like the previous times, I’ll meet with Wang Yi, the foreign minister and councilor, and then Yang Jiechi.


QUESTION: Okay.


SECRETARY POMPEO: So I would anticipate that’s all I’ll meet with.


QUESTION: Thanks, Secretary.

	Today’s terrorist threats are more complex, fluid, and fast-moving than ever. Terrorist groups and networks such as al-Qa`ida, ISIS, and Iranian-supported terrorists continue to target us, our allies, and partners. We must combat these threats through a comprehensive and coordinated approach. Earlier today, President Trump announced a new National Strategy for Counterterrorism that brings to bear all facets of American power to protect our people and interests. The President’s strategy emphasizes the importance of diplomacy and the role of international partnerships in combating the terrorist threats we face. The strategy recognizes the need for all nations to equitably share the burden of confronting terrorism, to expand the counterterrorism capabilities of our partners, and to work collaboratively to defeat the terrorists of today and tomorrow. As such, the State Department, in close coordination with other federal agencies, will continue to work with our allies and partners to implement the policies and tools necessary to eliminate our terrorist enemies and their networks of support.

SECRETARY POMPEO: Good morning, everyone. I want to update you on three issues, four if you want to count the – my upcoming trip to Asia, including North Korea.


	First, the situation in Iraq; the second, a statement about the ruling this morning from the International Court of Justice; and finally, I want to talk about my effort to put America’s diplomatic corps back on the field.


	To the situation in Iraq, Iran is the origin of the current threat to Americans in Iraq. It is to blame for the attacks against our mission in Basra and our embassy in Baghdad. Our intelligence in this regard is solid. We can see the hand of the ayatollah and his henchmen supporting these attacks on the United States.


	On Friday, I ordered the temporary relocation of U.S. Government personnel from our consulate general in Basra. I also warned the Iranian Government that we will hold it directly responsible for any harm to Americans or our diplomatic facilities, whether perpetrated by Iranian forces or by associated proxies or elements of those militias.


	These latest destabilizing acts in Iraq are attempts by the Iranian regime to push back on our efforts to constrain its malign behavior. Clearly, they see our comprehensive pressure campaign as serious and succeeding, and we must be prepared for them to continue their attempts to hit back, especially after our full sanctions are re-imposed on the 4th of November.


	The United States will continue to stand with the people of Iraq as they chart a future based on Iraqi interest, not those dictated by Iran. Even with the temporary relocation of our staff, we are supporting the delivery of clean water to the 750,000 residents in Basra.


	Now let me turn to the ICJ ruling from today. I’m announcing that the United States is terminating the 1955 Treaty of Amity with Iran. This is a decision, frankly, that is 39 years overdue. In July, Iran brought a meritless case in the International Court of Justice alleging violations of the Treaty of Amity. Iran seeks to challenge the United States decision to cease participation in the Iran nuclear deal and to re-impose the sanctions that were lifted as a part of that deal. Iran is attempting to interfere with the sovereign rights of the United States to take lawful actions necessary to protect our national security. And Iran is abusing the ICJ for political and propaganda purposes and their case, as you can see from the decision, lacked merit.


	Given Iran’s history of terrorism, ballistic missile activity, and other malign behaviors, Iran’s claims under the treaty are absurd. The court’s ruling today was a defeat for Iran. It rightly rejected all of Iran’s baseless requests. The court denied Iran’s attempt to secure broad measures to interfere with U.S. sanctions and rightly noted Iran’s history of noncompliance with its international obligations under the Treaty on the Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons.


	With regard to the aspects of the court’s order focusing on potential humanitarian issues, we have been clear: Existing exceptions, authorizations, and licensing policies for humanitarian-related transactions and safety of flight will remain in effect. The United States has been actively engaged on these issues without regard to any proceeding before the ICJ. We’re working closely with the Department of the Treasury to ensure that certain humanitarian-related transactions involving Iran can and will continue.


	That said, we’re disappointed that the court failed to recognize it has no jurisdiction to issue any order relating to these sanctions measures with the United States, which is doing its work on Iran to protect its own essential security interests.


	In light of how Iran has hypocritically and groundlessly abused the ICJ as a forum for attacking the United States, I am therefore announcing today that the United States is terminating the Treaty of Amity with Iran. I hope that Iran’s leaders will come to recognize that the only way to secure a bright future for its country is by ceasing their campaign of terror and destruction around the world.


	The third item, putting the diplomatic team from the United States Department of State back on the field: I want to talk about the fact that there are 65 nominees now sitting with the United States Senate. That’s over a quarter of all the senior-level confirmable positions that the United States Department of State is tasked with using to achieve its diplomatic outcomes. And I want every single American to know that what Senator Menendez and members of the Senate are doing to hold back American diplomacy rests squarely on their shoulders.


	Both Republicans and Democrats agree that a fully staffed State Department is critical to American national security. Indeed, when I was before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Senator Menendez told me, quote, “The problem is we have an emaciated State Department under this administration,” end of quote. Well, we’ve now done our part to fix that. He now needs to do his, and the Senate needs to do its part.


	These candidates are quality candidates. They are not sitting on the Senate floor because of objections with respect to their quality, their professionalism, or their excellence and their ability to deliver American foreign policy. Wave after wave of these extremely qualified nominees have been sent to the United States Senate.


	Let me give a few examples: John Richmond. He’s been stuck for 85 days while we try to make necessary progress on combating human trafficking, a priority for this administration and a shared priority of Senator Menendez. We have Kim Breier, the President’s nominee to head up Western Hemisphere Affairs, stuck for 204 days while the crisis in Venezuela and Central America continues to rage. David Schenker, the President’s nominee to lead the Bureau of Near East Affairs, is held up while the humanitarian crisis continues and while Iran continues to undermine peace and stability throughout the Middle East.


	Russia is seeking to prey on our elections, but Ellen McCarthy, a 30-year veteran of the Intelligence Community and the President’s choice to head the Bureau of Intelligence and Research sits on the Senate floor.


	As American forces are engaged against terrorists around the world, Clarke Cooper, an experienced military professional designated to lead the Bureau of Political-Military Affairs waits for the Foreign Relations Committee to act on his nomination.


	You should know that as a former member, I completely appreciate the Senate’s advice and consent role and their duty to conduct oversight. And I understand their need to be fair and honest brokers. But that’s not what is being engaged in. We need these people. What’s happening is unprecedented. We have members of the United States Senate who – for whom partisanship has now driven delay and obstruction of getting America’s diplomatic corps into every corner of the world.


	It will impact our operations, our ability. We don’t have a COO, the under secretary for management now coming on two years with no one filling that position, and enormous, complex operations keeping our diplomats safe around the world don’t have a senior leader to manage those operations. There are real, direct impacts of not having these people confirmed and I implore the United States Senate to take these quality, talented people and allow them to do what it is they have agreed to do on behalf of the United States.


	And with that, I’m happy to take a couple questions.


MS NAUERT: (Inaudible). We’ll start with Lesley from Reuters.


QUESTION: Thank you very much. Mr. Secretary, does the ruling of the World Court, does that have any practical impact on what the U.S. is – on U.S. sanctions, number one? And number two, what other – what assurances can you give that this will not impact any humanitarian aid? Because the Court actually said that it was not enough, that the U.S. – that the U.S.’s assurances were not adequate.


SECRETARY POMPEO: The United States has been very clear: We will continue to make sure that we are providing humanitarian assistance in a way that delivers for the people we have spoken very clearly about, the Iranian people. We care deeply about them. We will make sure that we continue to afford the flexibility so that that assistance can be needed.


	Having said that, the choices that are being made inside of Iran today – to use money to foment terror around the world, to launch ballistic missiles into airports throughout the Middle East, to arm proxy militias in Iraq and in Syria and in Lebanon – those are dollars that the Iranian leadership is squandering. They could be providing humanitarian assistance to their own people but have chosen instead a different path, a path of revolutionary effort around the world showing utter disregard for the humanitarian needs of their own people.


MS NAUERT: Nick Kalman from Fox.


QUESTION: I wanted to ask about North Korea, Mr. Secretary. The North Koreans have a new commentary saying the end-of-war declaration issue should’ve been resolved half a century ago in light of your trip coming up. Will it be resolved this weekend? And if not, what would be the reasoning against offering this?


SECRETARY POMPEO: So I’m not going to comment on the progress of the negotiations on the end-of-war declaration or any other items, only to say this: I’m very happy to be going back to get another chance to continue to advance the commitment that Chairman Kim and President Trump made back in Singapore in the second week of June. I’m optimistic that we’ll come away from that with better understandings, deeper progress, and a plan forward not only for the summit between the two leaders, but for us to continue the efforts to build out a pathway for denuclearization.


MS NAUERT: Next question, Michel from Al Hurra.


QUESTION: Yeah, thank you. Mr. Secretary, Russia has delivered today S-300 systems to Syria. You said in the past that it’s a serious escalation. Are you planning to take any measures in this regard? And my second question on Iraq. Any comment on the election of Barham Salih as the president and the designation of Adel Abdul Mahdi as the prime minister?


SECRETARY POMPEO: So I’ve had a chance to speak with the new speaker of the house and the new president. I’ve not had a chance to speak with the new – the president designee as of yet. I hope to do so. And I am equally hopeful that they will follow through on the commitments that they made when we spoke. These are people that we know pretty well. They’ve been around the Iraqi Government scene for some time, and what we talked about was building out an Iraqi Government that was an Iraqi Government of national unity that was interested in the welfare and future good fortunes for the Iraqi people, not controlled by the Islamic Republic of Iran. It’s something that was a shared set of objectives, and I’m very, very hopeful that we can continue to work with the Iraqi people and the soon-to-be-completed, formed new Iraqi Government to deliver against that.


	Your first question was about the S-300. I’m certainly not going to comment on our intention on how we will address that, but my comments before were true. Having the Russians deliver the S-300 into Syria presents greater risk to all of those in the affected areas and to stability in the Middle East. We consider this a very serious escalation.


QUESTION: Thank you.


MS NAUERT: Last question. Kylie from CBS News.


QUESTION: Hi, Secretary. Question. Can you explain to us a little bit the practical reality of the U.S. terminating the amity with Iran, and just how we’ll see that play out? And then secondly, just because we’re going to North Korea, is there any timeframe for what the U.S. wants to achieve given that last week we heard President Trump say that they’re not – the U.S. is not playing a time game, but you said that you want rapid denuclearization of North Korea completed by January 2021?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Those are entirely consistent with each other. We want it fast, but we’re not going to play the time game. My comment about 2021 was not mine. I repeated it, but it was a comment that had been made by the leaders who’d had their inter-Korean summit in Pyongyang. They’d talked about 2021 when they were gathered there, and so I was simply reiterating this as a timeline that they were potentially prepared to agree to.


	President Trump’s comments are exactly right. This is a long-term problem. This has been outstanding for decades. We’ve made more progress than has been made in an awfully long time. And importantly, we’ve done so in a condition which continues to give us the opportunity to achieve the final goal, that is the economic sanctions continue to remain in place, the core proposition; the thing which will give us the capacity to deliver denuclearization isn’t changing. If you heard the comments at the UN Security Council, complete unanimity about the need for those to stay in place.


	The Russians and the Chinese had some ideas about how we might begin to think about a time when it would be appropriate to reduce them, but to a country, they were supportive of maintaining the UN Security Council resolutions and the sanctions that underlay them. That is a – that is a global commitment that I’m not sure there’s many issues in the world you can find such unanimity. And so my efforts this week will be one more step along the way towards achieving what the UN Security Council has directed the North Koreans to do.


QUESTION: And the practical fallout from pulling out of the treaty?


SECRETARY POMPEO: We’ll see what the practical fallout is. The Iranians have been ignoring it for an awfully long time. We ought to have pulled out of it decades ago. Today marked a useful point with the decision that was made this morning from the ICJ. This marked a useful point for us to demonstrate the absolute absurdity of the Treaty of Amity between the United States and the Islamic Republic of Iran.


MS NAUERT: Thank you, everybody. We have to go now.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Thanks, everyone.

	I shall now make a statement in my capacity as Secretary of State of the United States of America.


	Time and time again over the past quarter century, the United Nations has made it clear: the world cannot accept a nuclear-armed North Korea. That’s not just the United States position. That is the world’s position.


	Past diplomatic attempts to halt North Korea’s nuclear and ballistic missile development were unsuccessful. But now we’re at the dawn of a new day. Since taking office, President Trump has led the international pressure campaign that has resulted in the first significant diplomatic breakthrough in decades.


	During President Trump and Chairman Kim’s historic Singapore summit, Chairman Kim committed to work towards the complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. The two leaders share a common personal understanding of what must take place for the transformation of the United States-DPRK relations.


	The United States continues to engage with North Korea to implement the commitments made in Singapore. Yesterday, I had a very positive meeting with Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho to discuss how we can move forward on all four commitments in the Singapore joint statement. We also discussed a second summit between President Trump and Chairman Kim Jong-un.


	We must not forget what’s brought us this far: the historic international pressure campaign that this council has made possible through the sanctions that it imposed. Until the final denuclearization of the DPRK is achieved and fully verified, it is our solemn collective responsibility to fully implement all UN Security Council resolutions pertaining to North Korea.


	President Trump has made abundantly clear that if Chairman Kim follows through on his commitments, a much brighter future lies ahead for North Korea and its people, and the United States will be at the forefront of facilitating that bright future.


	We want to see that time come as quickly as possible. But the path to peace and a brighter future is only through diplomacy and only denuclearization. That means any other path North Korea may choose will inevitably lead to ever-increasing isolation and pressure.


	It is imperative for members of the United Nations to take that to heart. Enforcement of UN Security Council sanctions must continue vigorously and without fail until we realize the fully, final, verified denuclearization. The members of this council must set the example on that effort, and we must all hold each other accountable.


	Particularly, we must all be accountable to enforce Resolution 2397, which lowered the annual cap on refined petroleum imports to North Korea. The United States has assessed – and we can say in no uncertain terms – that the cap of 500,000 barrels has been breached this year.


	We continue to see illegal imports of additional refined petroleum using ship-to-ship transfers, which are clearly prohibited under the UN resolution. As UN Security Council members, we must convey to the captains of these ships, to their owners, and anyone else involved in these transfers that we are watching them and that they must cease their illicit activity.


	We must all be accountable for cutting off North Korea’s illegal coal exports, which provide funds that go directly to its WMD programs.


	And we must be accountable, too, for curbing the number of North Korean laborers permitted within our borders. The United States is troubled by recent reports that member-states, including members of the Security Council, are hosting new North Korean laborers. This violates the spirit and the letter of the Security Council resolutions that we all agreed to uphold.


	And while sanctions remain part of the total approach we are pursuing to rid the Korean Peninsula of nuclear weapons, I want to finish on a positive note. We are well into a diplomatic process, and we hope – indeed, we want – to see this through to a successful end. I’m pleased that, based upon recent exchanges between President Trump and Chairman Kim, that the President has directed me to travel to Pyongyang next month to meet with Chairman Kim and to accelerate that process.


	I want to reiterate that the future can be very bright for North Korea if it makes good on its commitment to final, fully verified denuclearization. It will lead to the positive transformation of the U.S.-DPRK relations, to greater prosperity for the North Korean people, and to an enduring peace.


	In our vision for a free and open Indo-Pacific, nations are strong, sovereign, connected, prosperous, and at peace. But that vision for the region will never be complete if we fail to bring about this transformation on the Korean Peninsula. The Korean people, the region, and the world will never realize the full promise of the future if we do not seize this unprecedented diplomatic opening for peace.


	I said at the beginning of my statement that we are at the dawn of a new day in the world’s relationship with North Korea. We do not yet know what that day will bring, but we are hopeful that the current breakthrough in diplomacy will yield a brighter future for North Korea and a safer world for all of us.


	Thank you, and I look forward to the discussions.


	I give the floor now to the deputy prime minister and minister and foreign affairs of Kuwait.

QUESTION: Good morning, Gayle, and Secretary Pompeo, thank you so much for joining us live on CBS This Morning. I know you have a very busy day.


SECRETARY POMPEO: It’s great to be with you, Norah.


QUESTION: Lots to talk about. Let’s start first with North Korea. President Trump and the South Korean president said there is going to be another summit and that it will be soon. When will that happen and where?


SECRETARY POMPEO: So there will be another summit. The location and date have not been set yet, but we’re working diligently to make sure we get the conditions right so that we can accomplish as much as possible during this summit, but we hope it’ll be soon. I’ll personally be traveling to Pyongyang before too long to continue the work that’s ongoing even today to try and deliver on that.


QUESTION: You’re going to be going in the next couple of days?


SECRETARY POMPEO: I don’t know when it’ll be exactly. It’ll be very soon.


QUESTION: Do you expect that that summit will happen in October?


SECRETARY POMPEO: I don’t know when the summit will take place. We – it may happen in October, but more likely sometime after that. It takes a little while to put these together, and we want to make sure we’ve got the conditions just right so the two leaders can be successful.


QUESTION: South Korean President Moon Jae-in said that he was going to deliver a secret message from Kim Jong-un, the North Korean leader, to President Trump. What was in that message?


SECRETARY POMPEO: So the messages that we’ve been receiving from Chairman Kim have been very consistent. They are that he is intent on denuclearizing, he understands that, he understands the scope of that and what that means. He’s been very consistent in his commitment to delivering on that promise. We need to find our way forward to achieve that for the world. It’s great. I’m here at the UN this week. These are UN Security Council resolutions that are being enforced.


QUESTION: But it’s a lot of words at this point and I know you have been clear. You have set key demands. I mean, has the North declared their stockpile yet? No, right? I mean, have they set a timetable to give up these weapons? No. Have they agreed to inspectors? What steps have they taken to show proof that they are going to denuclearize?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Norah, I’ve been pretty consistent. I’ve also been consistent about the other item, which is I’m not going to talk about the conversations, the negotiations each day, the twists and turns. What we’re going to do is we’re going to continue the good work we have. We’re going to make sure there’s no more missile tests, no more nuclear tests. We’re going to continue to work on getting American remains back, we’re going to continue to work towards denuclearization, and it will take a while. There will be a process to this. President Trump’s been clear about that and clear-eyed about that since the very beginning.


QUESTION: The South Korean president gave an interview to Fox News’s Bret Baier, and in that he said that the North Korean leader will allow in inspectors, would be willing to verification. Is that true?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Yes.


QUESTION: And have any U.S. or international inspectors been inside North Korea?


SECRETARY POMPEO: So we’re working our way towards making sure that this verification that we have talked about since the beginning – and many have been skeptical, Norah – we’ve talked about this verification from the beginning. We’re not going to buy a pig in a poke. We’re going to get this right, we’re going to deliver on this commitment that Chairman Kim has made to the world, and then there’s going to be a brighter future for the North Korean people, and there’ll be a more peaceful world. That’s what the President talked about yesterday in his UN speech and there will be a wonderful outcome if we can get that.


QUESTION: And do you envision at this next summit with the North Korean leader that there could be an opportunity to sign a declaration to the end of the Korean War?


SECRETARY POMPEO: It’s hard to know. I don’t want to prejudge precisely where we’ll end up, but make no mistake about it, there is real progress being made and we’re going to continue to work at it until the point in time where, as the President says – we could be wrong, it may not happen – but until such time as we conclude we can’t get this done, we’re going to continue to drive to achieve the – continue the progress which we’ve already made.


QUESTION: Let’s talk about Iran. I know there was some talk that perhaps a meeting would happen between President Trump and Iran President Rouhani. Rouhani yesterday, before the UN, said that President Trump has tendencies resembling a Nazi disposition and that America’s First strategy is a symptom of weakness of intellect. How do you sit down with someone like that?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Well, there’s not going to be a meeting. President Trump has said when the Iranians are prepared to talk about fundamentally changing their behavior, then he is of course prepared to talk to them. Those statements yesterday indicate that they’re not in that place, and it is outrageous for him to say such a thing. For a Holocaust-denying country that is threatening Israel to compare the United States or its leader to Nazis is among the most outrageous things I have heard – and I will tell you, in diplomacy you hear a lot of them – the most outrageous things I have ever heard.


QUESTION: And yet you are ramping up sanctions on Iran and then the news that Europe, China and Russia are all going to create this backchannel so that they can keep economic relationships with Iran despite these U.S. sanctions. I mean, what does that say about our relationship with those countries and the fact that they’ve created this backchannel?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Look, I hosted a dinner with them last night. There are lots of places we’re working with our transatlantic partners in fundamentally important ways, on chemical weapons – lots of places where we have great overlap. They’ve taken a different path with respect to the JCPOA. That’s been clear for some time.


	Here’s what I’d say about their decision yesterday: To continue to create mechanisms to fund the world’s largest state sponsor of terror is disastrous policy and I hope they will reconsider it. But most importantly, European businesses are voting with their checkbooks. They are leaving Iran in droves. These sanctions will be effective, they are effective, and come November 4th, they’ll be even more effective.


QUESTION: Isn’t it a lot more effective, though, when the world enforces the sanctions than just U.S. sanctions?


SECRETARY POMPEO: We’re going to be incredibly effective. You can see it. Today, the rial trades at over 150,000 rial to the dollar. The economy is collapsing. There are two reasons for that. One is certainly the pressure that’s put in place, but most importantly, it’s the total chaos created by the Islamic Republic, Iran’s government. They treat their people horribly, they spend billions of dollars committing terror acts around the world, and they don’t take care of their people. And you see the protests, you see the anger on the streets of Tehran and in the rural areas. That’s a result of terrible government and the Iranian people aren’t going to stand for it, and the American people are going to stand with the Iranian people.


QUESTION: I know your time is short, want to quickly ask you about Russia, we – Russia. We are just 40 days from the midterm elections here in the United States. Is Russia trying to meddle in our elections again?


SECRETARY POMPEO: I have no doubt that the Russians have every intention of making life difficult for every American. This has been going on for decades, so please know, the American people should know, that the U.S. Government is actively engaged in efforts to ensure that the Russians, the Chinese, the Iranians, the North Koreans, all of those with malintent for America will not have the capacity to have substantial interference in the American elections. We are diligently working on this and I’m confident that we can achieve it.


QUESTION: So you’re confident that our elections will be safe in November?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Yes.


QUESTION: No question?


SECRETARY POMPEO: No question.


QUESTION: You’re pushing back hard on Russia?


SECRETARY POMPEO: No question. This administration has pushed back harder against Russia than any administration since the Cold War.


QUESTION: All right. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, we appreciate your time --


SECRETARY POMPEO: Thank you, Norah.


QUESTION: -- as you’re here on the world stage meeting with world leaders. Thank you very much.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Thank you, Norah. Have a good day.

SECRETARY POMPEO: Thank you. Thank you, all. Thank you. Thanks. So I’m still – it’s going to take me just a minute to recover. I was desperately afraid Senator Lieberman was going to ask me to translate some Latin – (laughter) – and my schoolteachers were going to realize how little I had worked.


	It’s great to be with you all here. Thanks for that kind welcome. It’s the first time my son’s ever given me a standing ovation. (Laughter.) That was good too. It’s great to see so many friends as well. It’s great to see my friend Yossi, director of Mossad.


	Good afternoon.


AUDIENCE MEMBER: Secretary, Mossad (inaudible). Americans want peace. Iranians want peace. Peace with Iran. We want peace. Americans want peace. Iranians want peace. Peace for the Iranian people.

SECRETARY POMPEO: This is the second time I’ve had someone interrupt a speech on this topic, and I am --


AUDIENCE MEMBER: We’re sick of you killing these Iranians. (Inaudible.)


AUDIENCE: (Boos.)


SECRETARY POMPEO: I reminded them all that it would be wonderful – that it would be a wonderful thing if they could protest like that in their – in the country of Iran, if they had that kind of First Amendment freedom. (Applause.) It was also very – it was very nice of you all to, like, plan seven hours ahead to get here on time, given the traffic this week. Thank you to – for your being so brave and getting out in all of this.


AUDIENCE MEMBER: (Inaudible.)


AUDIENCE: (Boos.)


SECRETARY POMPEO: I am – I’m honored to address you all – I especially do want to say a thank you. I mentioned Senator Lieberman before. Thank you for the invitation, Senator Lieberman. It was most kind of you to include me today. I know too that you’ll hear from Ambassador Bolton today. He and I share the President’s vision for how to move forward on this incredibly important issue. We will continue to be an uncompromising voice for national security sanity, just as you were, Senator Lieberman, during your time in service to the country.


	It’s an appropriate but sad irony that we’re talking about Iran during the 73rd UN General Assembly. So many times over the years, the UN – during the UN, Iranian regime leaders and diplomats have used this occasion to turn on their charm offensive with foreign governments, obscure what they’re really up to at home and abroad. Iranian President Rouhani – who has been tweeting the last hour – Foreign Minister Zarif, and other Iranian figures take this opportunity to present themselves as moderates – as moderate statesmen, indeed. But the world knows the truth, that their polished diplomatic waltz is a transparent trick to take responsible nations and try and make them think that maybe they aren’t so bad.


	In actuality, these are two of the highest-ranking officials of a regime which brazenly defies the vision of the United Nations, the requirements of international and the principles of national sovereignty. The Iranian regime’s track record over the past 40 years has revealed it as among the worst violators of the UN Charter and UN Security Council resolutions – perhaps, indeed, the worst violator. It is truly an outlaw regime.


	Let’s look at the UN Charter. It calls for our nations to “live together in peace with one another as good neighbors.” And where there is a threat to peace, it requires UN member-states to carry out decisions made by the Security Council as to what must be done to address that threat.


	Has Iran lived together with other nations in peace? Has it been a good neighbor? Has it contributed to the maintenance of international peace and security by fully abiding by the decisions of the Security Council? Let’s take a little walk around the world, and you’ll see the answer is a deafening “no.”


	Let’s start with Europe.


	Just a few months ago, authorities across Europe arrested several Iranian operatives – including an Iranian official based in Austria – as part of a plot to plant a bomb at a political rally in France. They grabbed this guy. It happened just as the regime has been putting a full-court press on European countries to stay in the nuclear deal.


	As a just response to this support for terrorism, a few weeks ago our ally France indefinitely postponed all non-essential diplomatic travel to Iran. It’s a good first step, and I thank France for that, and we hope to see more actions like this from other European nations. We must put pressure on the regime to rein in its destruction and demand that Iran act like a normal country.


	Unfortunately, just last night I was disturbed and, indeed, deeply disappointed to hear the remaining parties in the deal announce they’re setting up a special payment system to bypass U.S. sanctions. This is one of the most counterproductive measures imaginable for regional and global peace and security. By sustaining revenues to the regime, you are solidifying Iran’s ranking as the number one state sponsor of terror, enabling Iran’s violent export of revolution, and making the regime even richer while the Iranian people scrape by. I imagine the corrupt ayatollahs and the IRGC were laughing this morning.


	This decision is all more – all the more unacceptable, given the litany of Iranian-backed terrorist activity inside of Europe.


	In 2012, four Qods Force operatives entered Turkey to attack Israeli targets, but the attack was thankfully disrupted by Turkish authorities. That same year, Lebanese Hizballah – one of the regime’s most loyal proxies – bombed a bus in Bulgaria carrying six Israeli tourists. Six were killed, including a driver, and at least 32 were wounded. In 1992, Iran provided logistical support to Lebanese Hizballah operatives who assassinated four Iranian Kurdish dissidents at a cafe in Berlin.


	But Iran’s state-supported, lawless terror is not confined to Europe. It’s all over. Our journey continues to Africa. In 2013, three Iranian operatives were arrested in Nigeria for planning attacks against USAID offices, an Israeli business, a Jewish cultural center, and hotels frequented by Israelis and Americans. In 2012, two Qods Force operatives were arrested in Nairobi, Kenya for planning bomb attacks against Western interests; 33 pounds of explosive materials were found.


	How about South America? In Uruguay in 2015, a senior Iranian diplomat was expelled for planning an attack near the Israeli embassy. In Buenos Aires, Argentina, Iran provided logistical support for two suicide vehicle attacks – one in 1992 and then again in 1994. These attacks killed a total of 114 people and wounded nearly 500, with the 1994 bombing being the deadliest terror attack in the history of Argentina.


	The next stop on the tour is Asia. In Kathmandu in 2013, an Iranian traveling on a fake Israeli passport was arrested for conducting surveillance of the Israeli embassy. In New Delhi in 2012, the Qods Force directed a bomb attack targeted at an Israeli diplomat. In Karachi in 2011, Iranian operatives assassinated a Saudi diplomat. Since 2006, Iran has provided the Taliban with a broad range of arms, including rocket-propelled grenades, mortar rounds, rockets, and plastic explosives.


	Iran has tried to pull the same stunts right here on our continent. In 2011, the Qods Force supported a plan to assassinate the Saudi ambassador in the United States. This past August, the United States arrested two alleged agents of Iran for conducting covert surveillance and intelligence collection activities against Israeli and American targets here in the United States.


	In cyberspace, Iran has exploited the internet to inflame the fault lines of public opinion and to turn Americans against one another. Last month, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and YouTube collectively removed thousands of accounts originating from Iran for coordinating disinformation.


	In Australia, hackers linked to the IRGC have tried to steal sensitive research from universities.


	And of course, the Iranian regime has directed an array of violent and destructive activities to its neighbors in the Middle East.


	It provides Lebanese Hizballah, a terrorist organization, with $700 million each year. Hizballah is responsible for some of the most lethal terrorist attacks against Americans abroad in the Middle East. We all remember 1983. With the approval and financing of the Iranian regime, Lebanese Hizballah bombed the U.S. Embassy in Beirut, killing 63, including 17 Americans.


	And then again, in 1996, Hizballah bombed the Khobar Towers complex in Saudi Arabia, killing 19 U.S. Air Force personnel.


	This regime – this regime led by Rouhani and Zarif – provides over $100 million each year to terrorist groups like Hamas and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad. The most hypocritical part about this is that the ayatollah claims he cares about Palestinians. But from 2008 to 2017, Iran gave a total of $20,000 to the UN’s relief agency for Palestinian refugees. Meanwhile, the United States nearly – gave nearly $3 billion over the same period, 150,000 [times] more money to support the Palestinians than the terror regime in Iran.


	The regime also recruits impoverished youth in places like Afghanistan, Iraq, and Pakistan. It peddles a seductive vision of martyrdom to them and then ships them off to Syria to fight at the direction of Qasem Soleimani and his Qods Force. The regime has enticed Afghan children as young as 14 to take on the fight in Syria.


	Today, Iranian vessels harass ships in international waterways based on maritime claims made in defiance of international law. No, if the Iranian regime thinks the Strait of Hormuz belongs solely to them, you can bet your last rial that the United States will never stand for that. (Applause.) And at about 170,000 rials to the dollar, you can be sure we are focused on making sure that international waterways continue to remain open for trade.


	Just a few weeks ago, Iranian-supported militias in Iraq launched life-threatening rocket attacks against the U.S. embassy compound in Baghdad and at the U.S. consulate in Basra. Iran did not stop these attacks, which were carried out by proxies it has supported and funded and trained, and with which – and militias with which it has provided weapons.


	The United States will hold the regime in Tehran accountable for any attack that results in injury to our personnel or damage to our facilities. America will respond swiftly and decisively in [defense of] American lives, and we will respond against the source of the attack on American interests. (Applause.)


	You know we are here for big meetings at the UN. Each one of these defies the spirt of the UN Charter. But what about the letter of the UN Security Council Resolutions? A tally confirms that Iran is truly an outlaw regime. The list is long.


	Resolution 1373 requires all member-states to refrain from providing any form of support to entities involved in terrorist acts.


	Resolution 1701 requires all UN member-states to prevent the direct or indirect supply by its nationals from its territory of weapons to Lebanon, with just a handful of exceptions. But neither of these exceptions has stopped Iran from arming Lebanese Hizballah.


	Exports of arms from Iran are prohibited by UN Security Council Resolution 2231, and yet arms for the Houthis move in violation of that command from the United Nations.


	From 2006 to 2010, the UN Security Council passed six different resolutions governing Iran’s nuclear and ballistic missile programs. But from 20[07] to 2015, the IAEA Board of Governors issued less than – no less than 33 reports outlining Iran’s noncompliance with each of those resolutions.


	UN Security Council Resolution 1929 stated that, “Iran shall not undertake any activity related to ballistic missiles capable of delivering nuclear weapons.” But Iran conducted multiple ballistic missile launches between 2010 and 2015, every one of them in flagrant violation of UN Security Council resolutions.


	And even when, in connection with the JCPOA sanctions relief, the Security Council superseded this provision in UN Security Council Resolution 2231 with a call upon Iran not to undertake any activity related to such missiles, Iran’s pace of missile activity, missile launches, and tests did not diminish. Iran has conducted multiple ballistic missile launches since January 2016, when the deal was first implemented. Today Iran has the largest ballistic missile force in the Middle East, each of those ballistic missiles costing more than a million dollars.


	And that leads me to wonder how the struggling people of Iran feel about a missile program that drains their public treasury and causes economic sanctions that constrict their prosperity.


	Recently, the UN Working Group on the Arbitrary Detention – on Arbitrary Detention has concluded that the Government of Iran has no legal basis for the arrest and detention of the American graduate student Wang Xiyue.


	Last year, the UN working group called for the immediate release of another American, Siamak Namazi, who was arbitrarily arrested in 2015 while visiting his parents in Iran. In 2016, the working group also concluded that Bob Levinson, who has been missing in Iran for more than 11 years now, was arrested without legal grounds and should be immediately released.


	We continue to press Iran to uphold its commitment to assist the United States in locating Bob so he can return to his family. All these Americans and the others wrongly detained must come home. (Applause.)


	I talked about Mr. Rouhani’s tweets. They’re wasting a lot of time these days trying to discredit the United States over our lawful and justified decision to leave the JCPOA. But Iran’s own track record of violating international law is among the worst in the world. It has no regard for international law, borders, or lives.


	I don’t think I need to offer much more evidence than I have laid out here today. These are destructive activities undertaken by Iran in a global scope. It is therefore incumbent on every country to join our efforts to change the regime’s lawless behavior. The ongoing, multi-national, multi-continental nature of Iranian malign activity leaves no room for indecision.


	The United States will continue to coalesce international efforts to change Iranian behavior through pressure, deterrence, and support for the Iranian people. We want every single country on board. This is among the President’s top diplomatic priorities.


	The consensus – the consensus that already exists – on Iran nonnuclear activities is reflected in Security Council resolutions, the ones I just mentioned.


	But enforcement of those resolutions should be the bare minimum we ask of every nation.


	In the wake of President Trump’s decision to pull the United States out of the nuclear deal, countries are now facing a choice on whether to keep doing business in Iran. Reimposing sanctions and discouraging international business with Iran is not something we’re doing out of spite. This is a necessary security measure. The regime must no longer be allowed to get its hands on billions of dollars that it’s already proven it will spread around the world to its client states, rebel groups, and terrorists. Doing business in Iran only pours money into a regime that hoards it for itself and misuses it for violent ends. This all happened, of course, during the JCPOA.


	For decades, the world has sought to achieve the elusive goal of a stable Middle East. What better way – what better way to proceed toward it than denying the resources toward the regime most responsible for instability in the region? We must do whatever we can to stop the funding of the IRGC and the ministry of intelligence so that their agents cannot sustain terrorism and subversion on every continent. Make no mistake: These sanctions and our economic pressure are directed at the regime and its malign proxies, not at the Iranian people.


	That is why we have humanitarian exemptions to all of our statutory sanctions that are being reimposed and have a range of authorizations in place to allow for certain activities that actually benefit the Iranian people.


	If the world wants to see for itself the full extent of the Iranian regime’s malign activity, the United States has just released a booklet chronicling the destructive activities that the outlaw regime has perpetrated over the years.


	Please go online, take a look. It has a great and detailed list. It is a great resource too for anyone who wants to see what revolutionary priorities are like, what the regime really is all about.


	Indeed – I’ve talked a lot today. I’ve talked a lot today about the regime’s broken promises to UN member-states. It’s important, as we meet here, to talk about the relationship between Iran and its commitments to the United Nations. But the other constituency can put no – that can put no faith in the words of Iran’s leader are of course the Iranian people themselves.


	In 1978, before he returned from exile, the Ayatollah Khomeini gave an interview touting the glorious things to come for the Iranian people under the tenets of the Islamic Republic. Among other things, he promised the eradication of poverty, the improvement of condition of the life of the majority of the people who’d been oppressed in various manners, and all kinds of other good things that would come to the country.


	How’s that working out? There are psychic hotlines with more accurate predictions. (Laughter.)


	The president of Iran, Hassan Rouhani himself, has said many people have lost their faith in the future of the Islamic Republic and are in doubt about its power. This attitude, of course, is understandable with one-third of Iranian youth unemployed, while government parking garages are filled with Range Rovers and BMWs.


	Thanks to the regime’s failed policies, the Iranian people are battling drastic water shortages and environmental crises throughout their nation.


	Last year, Iran’s own energy minister said that 295 cities are facing droughts and water shortages. Meanwhile, the regime has spent untold billions of dollars on a nuclear program that has extended now over years. The Iranian regime is more concerned with heavy water than drinking water.


	In terms of improving the condition of those who have been oppressed, Iran still throws its citizens in prison. They bring up charges like “anti-revolutionary behavior,” “corruption on earth,” “siding with global arrogance,” and “crimes against Islam.” Regime vans cruise around the streets of major cities to round up women not obeying the restrictive hijab laws. As part of a larger persecution of the Sunni minority, last year one court sentenced four Sunnis to five years of imprisonment for the crime of jogging.


	The law prohibits Muslim citizens from changing or renouncing their religious beliefs, even the teaching of music. Music is discouraged in the schools.


	If nations are not moved by this evidence to change their policies towards Iran, that’s their choice. That is their prerogative. But how can any nation that claims to sympathize with the people of Iran keep sustaining trade relationships with lawless and oppressive Ayatollahs?


	The United States says this to the people of Iran: Our pledges of support do not end with our words. The United States hears you; the United States supports you. The United States is with you. We support your rights to live as a free people under a government that exercises accountability and treats you with respect.


	You deserve better than the fruitless revolution, a revolution that has been imposed on you by corrupt leaders.


	And our message is consistent. It’s consistent with what the protesters on the streets of Iran themselves are crying out for and what millions of Iranians in the world of – the worldwide diaspora have said for nearly 40 years. The United States seeks a better way forward with the Middle East.


	As President Trump and I have said many times, a new agreement is possible. Indeed, he said it even today. But change must come in the 12 areas I outlined in May, as well in – as with Iran’s human rights record.


	This week, our new special representative for Iran, Brian Hook, will meet the members of the Iranian diaspora here in New York. They will share their personal stories about what they and their family and friends have experienced and endured. Be sure, all Iranians who long for a normal government in Iran should be heard. We will continue these conversations to let the Iranian regime know unambiguously whose side we are on. (Applause.)


	I want to close with a quote from a great American who often crossed party lines to stand up for the truth, much like our good friend Senator Lieberman did. His name is Daniel Patrick Moynihan, also from this great state. Served 24 years as a senator from New York. He was also the United States ambassador to the United Nations under President Ford.


	He once said that, “The United Nations Charter imposes two obligations on members. The first, which is well-known, is to be law-abiding in their relations with other nations: not to attack them, not to subvert them, and so on. But there is a second obligation, which” is – “very simply is to be law-abiding in the treatment of one’s own citizens” as well.


	Iran has failed on both obligations.


	Ambassador Moynihan also once said “everyone is entitled to his opinions but not to his own facts.”


	The fact is that Iran’s charm offensive behind closed doors cannot cover up its string of broken promises in the Security Council chamber.


	The fact is that the Iranian regime robs its own people to pay for death and destruction abroad.


	The fact is that the outlaw Iranian regime has sabotaged the ability of the people on every continent to live in peace and dignity, including its own country.


	The United States asks every nation to come to term with these facts and hold Iran accountable in ways that it has not been held accountable to date.


	Only then – only then – can we take new and true steps towards greater security for our own peace-loving people and greater liberty for those inside of Iran.


	Thank you. God bless you all. (Applause.)

SECRETARY POMPEO: Good morning, everyone. It’s an honor to be here in New York for the 73rd United Nations General Assembly, my first as Secretary of State. Kind of the Super Bowl of diplomacy. Americans can be proud of how our entire team is executing on the field today. I’m thrilled to be here with my friends Nikki and John, as well.


	Americans expect the United States to assert bold leadership on the world stage that reflects our values. And under President Trump, we are certainly leading from the front.


	This was clear from just the first meeting this morning, in which we issued a call for Global Action for the World Drug Problem, the scourge of drug trafficking, narcotics production, and substance abuse is intensifying on a global scale. Within the United States, President Trump is leading a massive and effective counterattack against it. It’s now time for every country to follow our lead.


	Later today, the President will hold bilateral meetings with President Moon of South Korea, President Al-Sisi of Egypt, and President Macron of France. Whether it’s security issues, economic issues, human rights, or anything else, the President is asking for countries to exert their sovereignty to solve challenges and listening to what America can do to help.


	This emphasis on sovereignty was, of course, the theme of President Trump’s speech to the General Assembly last year. That theme will endure in his speech tomorrow, along with a recap about how his call for every nation to do its part has paid dividends for the United States and the world over this past year.


	For example, President Trump’s leadership, combined with efforts of countries to enforce the pressure campaign, has deescalated tensions with North Korea and brought us closer to our final goal: the final, fully verified denuclearization of the DRPK, as agreed to by Chairman Kim Jong Un.


	Last week’s summit between President Moon and Chairman Kim yielded another positive step forward, but the President remains resolute: Now is the not the time to ease pressure.


	And as you’ve heard too, President Trump will address the threat of nonproliferation at the Security Council, on Wednesday, and the need for responsible nations to stop the spread of weapons and technologies.


	Among the topics that meeting will cover are North Korea, Syria, and Iran. You can bet the President will have well-deserved strong words for the Iranian regime, which is among the worst of violators of U.N. Security Council resolutions, if not the absolute worst in the world. He’ll call on every country to join our pressure campaign in order to thwart Iran’s global torrent of destructive activity.


	Whether it’s Venezuela, South Sudan, Syria, Burma, China, the estimated 2.5 million victim — excuse me, 25 million victims of modern slavery around the world can also count on America’s support. Today is shaping up as a great first day. Lots more work to come this week.


	President Trump and our entire diplomatic corps look forward to the days with our foreign counterparts as we work on achieving shared victories for all.


	Ambassador Haley.


AMBASSADOR HALEY: Good morning. Happy UNGA. We got a great start today with the President’s event on counter-narcotics.


	Really, to understand this event is to understand the fact that it wasn’t just a bunch of people getting into a room. Every country that attended had to sign a Global Call to Action, which basically said that they were going to implement something within their own countries that dealt with how they were going to deal with the supply and demand of drugs, the international cooperation they were going to do with other countries to stop illicit drugs, and then also treatment that can be done within their own countries.


	And so the idea that the President was able to get 130 countries to sign on means that we are now having a global drug conversation that needed to be had for a long time.


	As we go through UNGA, you are seeing over 140 heads of delegations that are here at the United Nations. We certainly are looking forward to the President’s speech tomorrow. As you can tell, last year we started UNGA and it was trying to figure what the U.S. presence was going to be. This year, we’re here with a bang. Not only is the President doing his speech, he’s going to be doing a Security Council meeting. Secretary Pompeo is also doing a Security Council meeting. The Vice President is doing an event on Venezuela. And so it’s all hands on deck by the United States.


	He will be meeting with the Secretary-General. It’s been an interesting time knowing that, since the Secretary-General’s meeting last year, we have pulled out of the Paris Accord. We have pulled out of the Global Compact. We have pulled out of the Iran deal. And all of that is to say that the United States is determined to obviously be involved in multilateral organizations where we see it, but not in the way that they’re mandated on what the United States does or that infringes on the American people.


	So with that, he will be hosting the reception, obviously tonight, with the heads of delegations. And then tomorrow night, he and the Vice President and the Secretary have agreed to host our Security Council members, as well as their foreign ministers.


	And you know, with everything we’ve been able to get accomplished, whether it’s the arms embargo with South Sudan, whether it’s the idea that we were able to get three sanctions packages passed in North Korea, that we’ve got massive reform efforts that were done this past year and peacekeeping mandates completely rolled over. We would not be able to do that without the Security Council, and so that meeting is going to be very important.


	But we look forward to a great week. Everyone is excited. The United States is always very happy to host this. New Yorkers may not be, but we’re going to make it a great UNGA. Thank you very much.


AMBASSADOR BOLTON: Well, thanks. I’m just delighted to be here. Everybody have a copy? I’ve got mine. It’s a little worn, but I still got it.


	I just wanted to take a second and talk about one of the themes in the President’s remarks tomorrow. And I have been around long enough to know that I’m not going to step on any of his lines, but he is going to talk and elaborate on his views on sovereignty.


	And I just wanted to explain that this is — why this is so important for Americans, because many people consider sovereignty a kind of abstract concept. It derives, obviously, from the word “sovereign,” meaning the monarch. But it’s one of the reasons I think America is exceptional, and that is we understand sovereignty not to be vested in the head of state; we understand it as the Framers said in the Constitution itself: “We the People.” We the people are sovereign in America. So that infringements on our sovereignty are not infringements on abstractions or infringements on the government, they’re an infringement on the people themselves.


	We express our sovereignty through the Constitution, through our political process. It’s why that’s so important. And it’s why we believe — and of course, I’m speaking in secular terms here — that the Constitution is the highest authority that we recognize.


	So in a number of different ways, the President is going to address this issue. And again, it’s the continuing theme of his — as Secretary Pompeo said, it was a theme in his last address to the General Assembly, it will be this year, and in a variety of other contexts that you’ll see.


	Thank you.


MS. WALTERS: With that, we’ll open it up to questions. Steve Holland.


QUESTION: Mr. Secretary, will you raise with the Russians what you’re calling an “escalation” of sending these S-300 missiles to Syria?


SECRETARY POMPEO: So there are many topics that we’ll talk about with the Russians. I am very confident that their latest decision to move the S-300 will be amongst them.


	Ambassador Bolton has had the most recent conversation when he met with his counterpart now three weeks ago perhaps, four weeks ago.


	As I said yesterday, we’re trying to find every place we can where there is common ground, where we can work with the Russians. We’re finding lots of places where they’re working against American interest, and we will hold them accountable for so doing.


QUESTION: And will you meet with Lavrov while you’re here?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Yes. I’m sure Sergey and I will have our time together.


MS. WALTERS: Matt Lee from the AP.


QUESTION: I really don’t have anything to ask. I’m in the middle of writing something here. (Laughter.) But I will, I guess.


	Ambassador Bolton, when you talk about sovereignty and your threat to prosecute the International Criminal Court, do you expect the President will repeat that threat? And exactly what is the legal basis for saying that you will prosecute ICC prosecutors or judges?


AMBASSADOR BOLTON: Well, as I said a moment ago, I’m not going to say anything specific about what he’s going to comment on. And the authorities that I referred to in my speech to the Federalist Society are largely drawn from the American Service-Members’ Protection Act of 2002.


MS. WALTERS: John Roberts, Fox News.


QUESTION: Two questions. The first one is not exactly in your purview. But as you spent the morning with the President, do you have any idea what’s currently going on with the Deputy Attorney General?


SECRETARY POMPEO: We don’t have any comment. You’ll have to talk to the White House about that.


QUESTION: Okay, then let me ask my second question. North Korea. You’re having a lot of talks with North Korea. You’re not seeing what you need to in terms of denuclearization. How long do you leave the door open before you decide this isn’t working?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Yeah, John, look, you have to remember this is a process that will move forward. To set a date certain would be foolish. But make no mistake about it — the conversations that we’re having are important. They’re putting the opportunity to complete the denuclearization in place. And we will continue at every level to have those conversations. Some of them you will all be aware of; some of them you won’t know are taking place.


	There’s lots going on so that we can get to the place where — in this place, this week. Right? These are the U.N. Security Council resolutions that demanded that North Korea give up its nuclear weapons program and, even more broadly, its nuclear capabilities. Those aren’t United States demands; they are the United Nations demands. And we’re working to assist in implementing them and to help Chairman Kim get to the right place to honor the promise that he made to President Trump in Singapore.


QUESTION: Are you optimistic that he will come through on this?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Yes.


MS. WALTERS: Errol Barnett, CBS.


QUESTION: Secretary Pompeo, just to follow up on that point, President Trump said earlier today the second meeting will take place quite soon. So my specific question to you is: What does North Korea need to do before securing that meeting? Or has it already achieved that privilege?


SECRETARY POMPEO: I’m not going to get into the details about it, but the President said this morning they’ll meet quite soon. I’m confident that that will happen. I expect I’ll be traveling to Pyongyang before too long, as well, to make the final preparations for that second meeting between the two leaders.


QUESTION: Will that be before the end of the year? What is “soon”?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Yes. Lord willing, I’ll be traveling before the end of the year.


MS. WALTERS: Francesca Chambers.


QUESTION: Thank you, Lindsay. I’ll start with you, Secretary Pompeo. North Korea says that it’s looking for reciprocal actions from the United States in order to enter into a nuclear deal. What at this point would the United States be willing to give up to North Korea since you guys have said that sanctions are not on the table? And then, I have a second question on a second topic, but you might want to answer that first.


SECRETARY POMPEO: So I have said repeatedly and I shall remain steadfast: We’re not going to talk about the state of the negotiation — it would be inappropriate for us to do that — or our North Korean counterparts to talk about particular deal points, things we’re working on.


	But the fundamental principles remain the same. We expect the full, complete, verified denuclearization of North Korea. And until such time as that occurs, the economic sanctions — the sanctions that have been put in place by the United Nations Security Council — will remain in place. That’s the core proposition that the President agreed to in Singapore, and it’s the one we’re going to continue to honor through the whole process.


QUESTION: Okay, and then the second topic. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is among the U.S. allies who is not getting a private sit-down with the President this week, it would seem. So what does that say about the relationship between the United States and Canada right now? And what does it say about the possibility of securing a trade deal with Canada?


AMBASSADOR BOLTON: The President’s schedule is very compressed this year in New York, and so there were a lot of requests and a lot of desires by the President to have bilaterals that simply couldn’t be accommodated. He speaks with Prime Minister Trudeau by phone all the time. And it’s always possible here in New York that they would have time for a pull-aside, as we call it. But there is full and open, complete communication between Prime Minister Trudeau and President Trump. That I can assure you.


MS. WALTERS: Emerald Robinson, One America News.


QUESTION: Thank you, Lindsay. This is for either Ambassador Haley or Secretary Pompeo. In an update on Pastor Brunson, there’s rumors that he could be released next month. Any comment on that? Is that true? And are there conversations going on this week in regards to him and Turkish sanctions?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Yes, he could be released this month. He should have been released last month, and he should be released today, in fact. We’ve talked to the Turks; they know the expectation. Pastor Brunson and the other U.S. persons that are being held by Turkey all need to be released by Turkey. And they need to be done — that needs to be done immediately.


	And I’m sure there will be some conversations this week in furtherance of that. But no make no mistake, there will be nothing that we share with them here that we haven’t shared with them already about President Trump’s demands that these innocent people — these people who have truly done nothing wrong — not be detained wrongfully in Turkey.


MS. WALTERS: We can move to the back of the room.


QUESTION: Thank you. Thank you very much. Secretary Pompeo, my name is Majeed Gly. I’m from Rudaw Media Network. I have a question for you, Ambassador Bolton, or Secretary Pompeo, to answer questions about Iraq.


	Ambassador Haley last week elaborated very well at the Security Council of how Iran is practically taking over Iraq and influencing what’s going on there. Iran now is appointing the Speaker of the Parliament. They’re planning to appoint the Prime Minister of Iraq. They’re taking over the country. What is the U.S. planning to do in order to counter Iranian influence? Do you have specific plans with that regard? Thank you.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Thank you. You’re speaking about the Iraqi government formation process? Yes, sorry, I wanted to make sure I had the question right.


	This administration took over at time when Qassem Soleimani and the Ayatollah were running rampant through five capitals in the Middle East. And we have engaged in significant activity that has begun to counter the Iranian threat. Today they remain the world’s largest state sponsor of terror. It is our fervent effort to make sure that that not remain the case.


	We’ve put a number of restrictions in place. We will re-impose another set of sanctions come this November. Our actions in and around the Middle East have made clear we will not continue to accept Iran’s bad behavior.


	In Iraq, we have been working to achieve a government that is an Iraqi national government. And we’re hoping that the leaders — the people of Iraq have spoken. They had their chance to vote. And now they’re in the process of forming that government. And we are working diligently to make sure that the Iraqi people, the voice that they gave during their election, is who ends up in leadership there.


QUESTION: A follow-on. Kim Dozier from the Daily Beast. Rudy Giuliani over the weekend called for regime change in Iran. Does that follow with the Trump administration’s desires of policy?


AMBASSADOR BOLTON: As I’ve said repeatedly, regime change in Iran is not the administration’s policy. As Mike Pompeo just said, we’ve imposed very stringent sanctions on Iran. More are coming.


	And what we expect from Iran is massive changes in their behavior. And until that happens, we will continue to exert what the President has called “maximum pressure.” That’s what we intend to do.


MS. WALTERS: Jim Acosta, CNN.


QUESTION: Yes, Ambassador Haley, you’re the lone person here that has been with the administration since the beginning. In the story about Rod Rosenstein on Friday, it was mentioned that he had been involved in circulating discussions about invoking the 25th Amendment to have the President removed from office. Were you ever involved in any of those discussions? Were you aware of any of those discussions? And I did have a North Korea follow-up for the Secretary.


AMBASSADOR HALEY: I mean, I said yesterday, on the Sunday shows, that, literally, I have never once been in the White House where that conversation has happened. I am not aware of any Cabinet members that are even talking about that. It is completely and totally absurd. No one is questioning the President at all. If anything, we’re trying to keep up the pace with him, in the fact that he’s got a lot he wants to accomplish very quickly, and we’re going to continue to support him in the way that he does that.


QUESTION: I appreciate that. And, Secretary Pompeo, if I may ask you a follow-up on North Korea. Before you went into the summit with Kim Jong Un in Singapore, you did not have an agreement really in place for complete denuclearization. Why should you have another summit with Kim Jong Un — a second summit the President talked about this morning — if you don’t have the details in place? It just seems, even to the layman, that you sort of have the process backwards; that you would want the details in place before having a summit. And here you may do it for a second time.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Two things. Fact check: I’ve been with the administration since the beginning too. Not that that’s relevant. (Laughter.) But I’ll add, no discussion with me about the 25th Amendment anywhere either.


QUESTION: Oh, thank you. I appreciate that. Yes, sir.


SECRETARY POMPEO: So you can now report that there are two senior leaders that have said that your statement — your question was ludicrous. (Laughter.)


	Second point, with respect to North Korea: Look, we went —


QUESTION: Well, if it’s so ludicrous — if I may ask, if it’s so ludicrous — and I apologize for not remembering that you were the CIA Director. Obviously, you were the CIA Director. If it’s so ludicrous, why did the Deputy Attorney General have discussions about it behind the scenes?


SECRETARY POMPEO: I find the question ludicrous. I’ve been involved — I’ve been at the center of this administration, along with lots of other folks, from virtually day one. I think it was actually day three or four. I’ve never heard anyone talk about it, whisper about it, joke about it in any way. I’ve been in a lot of meetings with a lot of senior officials from this government.


	Your question on North Korea: Remember the history. We went at this the other way for decades, and North Korea continued to build its nuclear program. Right? We tried to do details. We tried to do step-for-step. We tried to do trade-for-trade. Each of those failed.


	We’re coming at this from a different direction. We’re bringing the two senior leaders, the individuals who can actually make the decisions that will move this process forward, bring them together so we can continue to make progress towards what the U.N. Security Council has demanded and what Chairman Kim has promised he would do.


	That’s the effort. There remains work to be done. There will be some time before we get to complete denuclearization for sure. But we’ve been at this the other way for an awfully long time and failed, and put America in the position it finds itself today: At risk from North Korean nuclear weapons.


QUESTION: And wouldn’t it be ludicrous to have another meeting with Kim Jong Un if you don’t have the details in place?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Absolutely not. If we can continue to make progress and have conversations, I think there’s enormous value in that.


MS. WALTERS: (Inaudible) in the back.


QUESTION: Yeah, hi. Secretary Pompeo, in your terms about denuclearization, you left out the word “irreversible.” Was that a mistake or deliberate?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Complete mistake. Completely irreversible. Thank you. Thank you for correcting me.


MS. WALTERS: Thank you all for attending today. Thank you.

	On behalf of the Government of the United States of America, I send my best wishes to the people of Guinea-Bissau as they celebrate 45 years of independence.


	The United States and Guinea-Bissau first established diplomatic relations in 1975. The United States has developed an important relationship with Guinea-Bissau based on shared principles of expanding democracy, improving the health of the people of Guinea-Bissau, and stimulating economic growth through multi-sector reforms. The United States congratulates Guinea-Bissau on establishing an Agency for the Promotion of Exports and Entrepreneurial Development. Through recent accomplishments, Guinea-Bissau will continue to advance as a partner in West Africa.


	As we celebrate the anniversary of Guinea-Bissau’s independence, the United States offers best wishes for a joyous and safe holiday and the reaffirmation of our enduring friendship.

QUESTION: Meanwhile, there’s another explosive controversy: whether President Trump will fire Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein after reports that in May of 2017, Rosenstein was so worried about Mr. Trump’s behavior he discussed wearing a wire to record the President and polling cabinet members about invoking the 25th Amendment to remove him from office.


	Secretary of State Mike Pompeo became the first top administration official to speak on this when I interviewed him yesterday.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Chris, I’m not going to comment on that in any way, other than to say this: I’ve been pretty clear since my beginning of service here in this administration. If you can’t be on the team, if you’re not supporting this mission, then maybe you just ought to find something else to do. I’ve told that to my senior colleagues, I’ve told it to junior folks at the CIA and the State Department. We need everyone who is engaged in helping achieve President Trump’s mission, and I hope that everyone in every agency – DOJ, FBI, State Department – is on that mission. And if you’re not – if you’re not, you should take this time to go do something more productive.


QUESTION: And I assume that talking about wiring the President, talking about the 25th Amendment, is not being on the team?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Not remotely.


QUESTION: We’ll have more of our interview with Pompeo later this hour.


	(Break.)


QUESTION: Mr. Secretary, welcome back to Fox News Sunday.


SECRETARY POMPEO: It’s great to be with you, Chris.


QUESTION: This week, North Korean leader Kim Jong-un talked about dismantling missile test sites, nuclear fuel facilities. President Trump called it very positive: “We had very good news from North Korea, South Korea. They met, and we had some great responses. We’re making tremendous progress with respect to North Korea.” But the North Koreans have not agreed to give up a single missile, a single nuclear weapon, nor are they giving us the inventory of their arsenal. Is that tremendous progress?


SECRETARY POMPEO: You have to step back to where we began this administration, with a well-developed program inside of North Korea. We have now achieved the ceasing of missile testing, the ceasing of nuclear testing, we have gotten the remains of 55 Americans, we’re in deep discussions about how to proceed with respect to denuclearization. President Moon traveled to Pyongyang for the third time this past week and made progress. We’re continuing to make progress.


	These are all the right steps forward. It’s the right path. And we’ve made clear to the world that the economic sanctions, the pressure that has caused Chairman Kim to come as far as he has come to date, will remain in effect until denuclearization occurs. And so we’re hard at it. President Trump has given me the task to use our entire diplomatic team to achieve the outcome that the world has demanded through UN Security Council resolutions. We’ll talk a lot about that in the week ahead in New York.


QUESTION: But again, you talked about denuclearization. They haven’t given up a single nuclear weapon or missile or an inventory, and now they’re talking in the meeting, the summit with South Korean President Moon, they talked about, quote, “corresponding measures” such as a treaty to end the Korean War. One, is that on the table? And two, whatever happened to the position of the administration that North Korea has to get rid of all of its arsenal before we give any concessions?


SECRETARY POMPEO: The administration position hasn’t changed one jot from the time we entered this discussion. We are working diligently to achieve many of the outcomes that you describe. We have had extended conversations about this. I don’t want to get into the details of the negotiations that are underway, but we’ve talked about particular facilities, particular weapon systems. Those conversations are underway, and we are hopeful that we can deliver this outcome for the world.


QUESTION: But to get to this point about corresponding measures, you say the position hasn’t changed one bit. Does that mean they have to get rid of their entire nuclear arsenal and missiles before we take – we give concessions, for instance, a peace treaty?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Everybody’s got their own idea of what a concession might be. Some thought it was a concession for President Trump to go to Singapore. I certainly didn’t think so. President Trump doesn’t. But what we’ve made clear is the economic sanctions, the driving force to achieve the outcome we’re looking for, will not be released and the UN Security Council will not reduce those sanctions until such time as we have achieved that final denuclearization.


QUESTION: I want to pick up on that because the South Koreans are already talking about renewing economic relations with South Korea. The Russians and the Chinese are looking the other way. There’s been apparently rampant smuggling of oil, fuel into South Korea. Isn’t the U.S. policy of maximum pressure on North Korea, isn’t that releasing its grip?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Absolutely not. I mean, just I hear, I’ve read what – you should – you should be very careful about everything that you read in the press around the world. The entire UN Security Council remains committed to enforcing the UN Security Council resolutions. I am confident we will renew that and renew the commitments to that in the week ahead. It’s one of the things we’ll talk a great deal about. To a country, every nation has told me personally they remain committed to enforcing the UN Security Council resolutions.


QUESTION: Let’s turn to China, where we are on the verge of a major trade war. The U.S. has imposed sanctions or tariffs on $250 billion of Chinese imports. The Chinese have retaliated. They have just announced they’re pulling out of a new round of trade talks this week. How hard is President Trump prepared to go in this faceoff with China, and for how long?


SECRETARY POMPEO: We know this much: The trade war by China against the United States has been going on for years. Here’s what’s different in this administration: To the extent one wants to call this a trade war, we are determined to win it. I ran a small business in Kansas before I came to Congress. I saw how companies were treated differently when they attempted to do business, whether they were trying to sell goods into China or to purchase goods, to export from China. I watched how American companies were treated unfairly, differently, a different set of rules. If they wanted to invest in my business in Kansas, they could have. Had I wanted to invest in a Chinese supplier there, I couldn’t. These are fundamentally unfair. The American people know that, and President Trump is going to fix it.


QUESTION: When you say he’s – you’re going to win it?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Yeah, we’re going to win it.


QUESTION: As long as it takes?


SECRETARY POMPEO: We’re going to win it. We’re going to get an outcome which forces China to behave in a way that if you want to be a power, a global power – transparency, rule of law, you don’t steal intellectual property, the fundamental principles of trade around the world, fairness, reciprocity – those are the things President Trump has told his counterpart there, who he very much likes. Those are the things the American people are demanding and the American workers deserve.


QUESTION: President Trump announced this week that he’s reducing the number of refugees that will be allowed into this country from 45,000 this year to 30,000 next year, which would be the lowest cap since the refugee program began in 1980. Now take, for instance, Syria. There are five million Syrian refugees now in the Middle East. The U.S. has allowed only 60 Syrian refugees into this country this fiscal year, which ends next week. Is that this administration’s idea of compassion?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Chris, this country has been the most generous nation in all of recorded civilization with respect to taking refugees from around the world and admitting people from outside of the United States. It continues to be so under President Trump and will be during our administration.


	Let’s talk about the refugees in Syria. The best place for those refugees to go back to would be to their homes. It’s where they want to go. We have provided billions of dollars in aid, in humanitarian aid, all around the world in the Trump administration, and we’ve let in over four million people to our country over the past two decades. This is a generous nation. To focus just on this legal term, refugees, on this notion of refugees, doesn’t encompass the full scope of American generosity.


	Second point, President Trump is also committed to making sure that America is secure, and the vetting that’s taking place is important. It reduces risk in the American homeland.


	And then finally, the work that we’ve done to get our allies to share this burden. We now have hundreds of million dollars coming in from Gulf states to support Syrian reconstruction and redevelopment, things that never happened. This was good work driven by the President, led by American diplomacy, to get other countries to share the burden of making sure that these refugees are well taken care of.


QUESTION: New subject. This week, the President ordered the release of previously classified documents about the Russia investigation. That release has been delayed, at least temporarily, but he says they show that the Russia probe began as a hoax: “It’s a terrible witch hunt and it’s hurt our country. And the things that have been found over the last couple of weeks about text messages back and forth are a disgrace to our nation.”


	You were CIA director until just this May. Did you see any legitimate reason to investigate ties between any Trump associates and the Kremlin? Did you see any legitimate basis to surveil Carter Page?


SECRETARY POMPEO: I’ve consistently said I’m not going to talk about the investigation. I had the role of CIA director, and so I don’t have anything to add to that today.


QUESTION: But can you tell us whether or not it was a hoax or whether there were legitimate national security concerns?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Oh, I’ve been very clear. We have real risk to outside agents trying to do harm to America. There is no mistake about that. There are many countries seeking to meddle in our elections: the Chinese, the Iranians, the North Koreans. And certainly, what the Russians did in 2016 are all clear indications that there are those who want to undermine American democracy. And we have an obligation, both the intelligence community, our military, our diplomats, all of the U.S. Government, to prevent that from ever happening.


QUESTION: Finally, there was an attack on a military parade in Iran this weekend in which at least 24 people were killed, and your Iranian counterpart, Foreign Minister Zarif, blames it on the U.S. Did the U.S. play any role in that attack? And do you have any plans, or does the President have any plans, to meet with Iranian officials this next week at the UN General Assembly?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Let me take your second question first. I don’t know that there are any plans to date. The President has been pretty clear: If there are constructive conversations to be had with the Iranians, the President is happy to have them. He’d be willing to do so.


QUESTION: Even with President Rouhani this week?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Well, the leader of the country is Ayatollah Khamenei. That’s who is running the show in Iran. I think that would be an important and interesting conversation. With respect to --


QUESTION: Wait, I mean, are you just – is that talk, or are you just saying you would like, the President would like, to meet with the Ayatollah?


SECRETARY POMPEO: The President has said he’ll talk with anyone if we can a constructive conversation. We want Iran to stop being the largest – the world’s largest state sponsor of terror. But make no mistake about it; there is no indication that they have any intent of doing this. Just this past couple weeks, they’ve come after American interests inside of Iraq, in Basra and in Baghdad.


	And with respect to the attacks overnight, I saw the comments of Zarif. When you have a security incident at home, blaming others is an enormous mistake. And the loss of innocent life is tragic, and I wish Zarif would focus on keeping his own people secure rather than causing insecurity all around the world.


QUESTION: Mr. Secretary, thank you.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Thank you, Chris.


QUESTION: Good luck this next week at the UN.


QUESTION: Thank you, sir.

",Interview With Chris Wallace of Fox News,http://www.state.gov/secretary/remarks/2018/09/286143.htm
"September 23, 2018","
QUESTION: Mr. Secretary, welcome back to Meet the Press.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Chuck, it’s great to be with you. It’s great to host you here.


QUESTION: Yes, it’s very nice to be here. Let me start with the issue of the FISA warrant and what the President was asking to get declassified. He seemed to say in an interview on Thursday night that a few allies had complained about the potential declassification of these FISA documents that have to do potentially with Carter Page. What more can you say? I assume it’s the Five Eyes. Is it the UK, is it that group of nations that are trying to keep us from making this stuff public?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Chuck, I can’t add much more to that, other than to say this: In my previous role as CIA director, and now as the Secretary of State, we are committed to making sure that we classify information properly. We try to get information out that shouldn’t be classified. It’s a historic problem in the United States Government. And second, we will always make sure that we protect our sources, our methods, information that comes in from partners that share with us. We understand how important that is, and President Trump and our team will always make sure that we do that right.


QUESTION: Has that order been fully rescinded or put on hold? It’s – has he pulled back on it officially?


SECRETARY POMPEO: I’ll leave to the White House that. It’s not my neck of the woods these days. But make – I want the American people to know that we will always protect information we need to, and then we will do everything we can to be as transparent as America demands as well.


QUESTION: If you could give yourself advice when you were the head of the intelligence committee, what have you learned, both being at CIA and here at State, that you would tell yourself – boy, now I – that’s something I didn’t understand, and I could have been a better House Intel Committee chair on accountability because of X? What advice would you give yourself going backwards?


SECRETARY POMPEO: One of the things you get to see when you actually run the organization is the enormous depth and breadth of the capacity of American – whether it’s in our Intelligence Community or our diplomatic forces. I think you underappreciate that when you’re a member of Congress. You get to see glimpses, but you don’t get to see the whole of the body, the sum of the greatness.


QUESTION: Do you think if some of these members saw what you saw they would be a little less conspiratorial?


SECRETARY POMPEO: I do.


QUESTION: And is there a way to – do you think members of Congress should see more of this stuff so that maybe they wouldn’t be so conspiratorial and really get the – calm the public down a little bit?


SECRETARY POMPEO: So I’ve tried to do that both in my previous role and this one. I try to be as open and on my front foot sharing information as I can possibly be, proactive in communicating, so that there is a better understanding. Look, sometimes being conspiratorial is appropriate too. Sometimes asking hard questions, it’s their job, their oversight role.


QUESTION: Sure.


SECRETARY POMPEO: So I don’t begrudge them that in any way.


QUESTION: But the tone, you think they could change that a little bit?


SECRETARY POMPEO: I would hope that the tone would be one where we’re trying to all get at the same end, which is achieving America’s foreign policy objectives.


QUESTION: This, of course, all has to do with Russia. And I say this in a – and I was preparing for this interview, and questions I had about North Korea, there was a Russian angle; questions I had about Iran, there’s a Russian angle; questions I had about Syria, there’s a Russian angle. The Russians don’t seem to be helpful on any front here. Is that a fair assessment?


SECRETARY POMPEO: It’s a pretty fair assessment, and it’s most unfortunate because there are places where we have shared interest. I worked with them closely on counterterrorism issues. There’s a handful of other places in the world where we do have overlapping interests, although certainly not values. They’re a country that’s very different from ours in that respect.


	They have not proven helpful in the Ukraine, in Syria. You’ve shown it. We, this week, sanctioned – put sanctions on China as a result of the CAATSA law that passed, again, trying to push back against Russia’s malign activity around the world. The President is trying to develop a relationship and change that, but we’ve not been successful, at least to date.


QUESTION: It seems like it’s a good cop/bad cop. You’re being bad cop, Secretary – or maybe realistic when it comes to Russia, and the President has been trying to play good cop. Is that not working?


SECRETARY POMPEO: I don’t think that’s the situation at all. I think the predicate of your question is --


QUESTION: You don’t accept it?


SECRETARY POMPEO: -- just wrong. I think we’re all trying to be cops that are protecting America, and I think we have actually achieved that, Chuck. I do believe America is fundamentally safer today than it was when President Trump took office for a host of reasons.


QUESTION: If Assad uses chemical weapons, are you going to hold Russia accountable for this?


SECRETARY POMPEO: The President has been very clear: We will go to the source of the bad behavior. We --


QUESTION: Who is the source of that bad behavior, though – Assad or the Russians?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Well, we’ll have to analyze once the activity takes place. We pray that it doesn’t. But we’ll do our intelligence, our forensics; we’ll do our hard work, and we will hold accountable those that are responsible for violating this fundamental principle, this idea that chemical weapons are fundamentally different than other types of weapons systems.


QUESTION: So Russia needs to know that it could be held accountable here if they’re not careful?


SECRETARY POMPEO: We sanctioned – we’ve sanctioned Russia for chemical-biological weapons use, what they did in Skripal. The President is deadly serious to make sure that chemical weapons don’t become the norm in the way nations act around the world.


QUESTION: Are we afraid to use – are we – would you rule – have we ruled out using a military response if we see something like that?


SECRETARY POMPEO: We’re not going to rule out a single thing, Chuck.


QUESTION: Let me move to Iran here. You’ve said it isn’t about regime change. So let me ask you this: If Rouhani wants a pull-aside with President Trump next week at the UN, is it gonna happen?


SECRETARY POMPEO: I think the President has been pretty clear about that. He’s happy to talk with folks at any time.


QUESTION: So no precondition on that?


SECRETARY POMPEO: If there’s a constructive dialogue to be had, let’s get after it.


QUESTION: Is there one right now with the Iranians?


SECRETARY POMPEO: We’ll have to see. It doesn’t seem likely. Their behavior wouldn’t indicate any intention to change the fundamental challenge that Iran presents to the world.


QUESTION: How do you make sure that the United States doesn’t look like it’s taking sides in Sunni versus Shia here? You guys are going to get tough on Iran this week. The President is going to chair this General Assembly meeting. But it does look like the United States is on every Sunni side of an issue. How do you sort of make sure that the United States isn’t sending that message?


SECRETARY POMPEO: I don’t think the members of ISIS would share your view. We’ve been incredibly hard on terror from wherever it comes, whether it’s a Shia, whether it’s the Sunnis, or whether it’s anyone else engaged in terror around the world. Our objective is to protect American interests, and we will protect them no matter who it is perpetrating them, whether they come from a religion, no religion, or the Shias, or the Sunnis.


QUESTION: Are the Russians helpful at all on Iran?


SECRETARY POMPEO: They’ve not been to date.


QUESTION: Do you think they can be?


SECRETARY POMPEO: I always live in hope, Chuck. And indeed, it’s my mission. As America’s most senior diplomat, it is my task to convince the Russians too that firing rockets from Yemen into major Gulf states, arming Lebanese Hizballah, Kata’ib Hizballah, all of these activities, these aren’t in Russia’s best interest either. And just come – just coming at America to poke us in the eye is not a foreign policy objective. That’s being a nuisance. And what I’d hope they do is they’d come to understand that we do have places where taking down terror matters to each of our two peoples.


QUESTION: All right. I know – I’m short on time so I want to make the final issue North Korea. You may end up meeting with your counterpart. I believe there’s an invite there. Kim Jong-un seems to want to have another summit with President Trump. Any preconditions before that could happen again?


SECRETARY POMPEO: We have to make it work. That is, we have to --


QUESTION: What’s “make it work,” though?


SECRETARY POMPEO: We have to build it out, we have to set up the logistics, we’ve got to set the right conditions. But President Trump very much is prepared to meet with Chairman Kim at the right time, and we hope that’ll happen in the not-too-distant future.


QUESTION: Have the North Koreans been honest about their nuclear program compared to what we know of their nuclear program? Have they been honest yet with the world?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Here’s what I’d say about North Korea. We came in. There was the risk of war. We’ve taken that threat down by taking the temperature down by beginning this set of discussions. They have stopped missile firings and nuclear testing. That’s all to the good. We got back the remains of some of our soldiers. That’s to the good.


	We have our eyes wide open. There is a long ways to go to get Chairman Kim to live up to the commitment that he made to President Trump and indeed to the demands of the world and the UN Security Council resolutions to get him to fully denuclearize. But our team is fully engaged in this. There are lots of conversations taking place. There’s lots of work being done. It isn’t all visible to the public, but we are fully engaged in the process. We understand the objective, and economic sanctions will remain in place until we get there.


QUESTION: It sounds like you’re saying that yes, he hasn’t been fully honest yet.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Nope, you shouldn’t take anything away from what I’ve said.


QUESTION: No?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Only that there remains a great deal of work to do, and we have the patience and determination and the President’s mission statement to us at the State Department to make that happen.


QUESTION: Mr. Secretary, I’m going to leave it there.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Great.


QUESTION: Thanks for coming on.

QUESTION: Mr. Secretary, thank you very much. I know your time is very short going into these UN meetings, so thanks for seeing us today.


SECRETARY POMPEO: You’re most welcome. It’s good to be with you, Andrea.


QUESTION: And I wanted to ask you about North Korea first of all. President Moon is bringing a message from Kim Jong-un that he wants – South Korea wants – the U.S. to help in declaring peace, ending the conflict, the war, that has gone back all of these decades. Why should the U.S. reward Kim Jong-un when he has still not met any of your three demands: to declare his stockpile of weapons, to set a specific timetable for giving up these weapons, to verify it, to make it irreversible?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Well, you have to remember where we entered the picture in this administration. We were watching their program continue to expand, watching missile tests and nuclear tests take place.


QUESTION: But isn’t that the point? He’s fooled three previous American presidents. How do we know he’s not playing us?


SECRETARY POMPEO: This is fundamentally different. The approach that this administration has taken is fundamentally different than in each of the previous negotiations between both Democratic and Republican presidents. The economic sanctions, the issue that drove Chairman Kim to ultimately meet with President Trump and have the historic summit, remain in place, jot and tittle. These aren’t American sanctions, these are global sanctions put in place -- 


QUESTION: In fact, there are reports, sir, of --


SECRETARY POMPEO: -- by the entire world, the UN Security Council resolution. So we’ve known this was going to take time. We knew that it wouldn’t happen instantaneously. But each step, including the visit from President Moon where they made an incremental progress – for the first time the North and South spoke about denuclearization in a material way. These are important steps. There’s much work remains to be done, and we have the patience and determination – and we believe the world does too – to achieve this goal.


QUESTION: But China and Russia are taking the signal, certainly, from the summit meeting and from the President’s declaration of progress that the nuclear threat is over. The smuggling is spiking, oil smuggling, since the summit. The signal to the rest of the world is – excuse me – to ease off of sanctions.


SECRETARY POMPEO: That’s not the signal I’m hearing from the rest of the world – the European countries, countries from the Middle East, indeed China and Russia both have stated their continued commitment to enforce the UN Security Council resolutions. There’s always a gap. We’re working diligently on enforcement of those Security Council resolutions and that – those economic sanctions will remain in place until we get to the end, till we get to that final denuclearization which Chairman Kim promised to President Trump he would undertake.


QUESTION: There are a lot of reports that – ours as well as others – not only of increased smuggling but also that he is actually expanding his arsenal, not limiting his arsenal. He’s making a lot of promises now. Are they enough to justify another summit, a second summit, with the President?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Ultimately, that’ll be a decision for the President.


QUESTION: Would you --


SECRETARY POMPEO: I’m hopeful that I’ll get a chance to travel again to Pyongyang to continue these negotiations before too long, and that before too long – and then in relatively short order I hope the two leaders get together again to continue to make progress on this incredible, important issue for the entire world.


QUESTION: The President is going to be hosting a Security Council meeting on nonproliferation, but he’s tweeting today it’s really about Iran. Are you signaling in a lot of your policies that you really want a soft regime change, or a real regime change? Do you see Rouhani from Iran – President Rouhani – meeting with the President of the United States?


SECRETARY POMPEO: We’ve made very clear that regime change is not President Trump’s policy. We’ve laid out what it is we want from the Islamic Republic of Iran. It’s pretty straightforward, Andrea. How about this: For starters, stop launching missiles into Riyadh, arming Hizballah, and threatening Israel. How about ceasing to be the world’s largest state sponsor of terror. These are simple demands that we make of every country in the world, and that’s what we’re looking for from Iran as well. When the Islamic regime makes that change, we’ll be happy to have a conversation with them. President Trump’s made that very clear. But there’s no signs that they’re backing off continuing their terror threats around the world.


QUESTION: On Yemen, you have indicated continued backing of the war in Yemen even after the killing of 40 schoolchildren by a Saudi airstrike, a school bus. A lot of people in this State Department believe that we should not be continuing this support, and the argument is that you and the administration are doing it because of the $2 billion in arms sales, to avoid jeopardizing those arms sales to the Saudis and to the others in the region.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Yeah, I find that suggestion offensive. The reason we’re continuing to work in Yemen is to try and resolve that situation through the UN-directed peace operation. We support that effort. We’ve continued to support that effort. The killing of the children is tragic. The Saudis have taken responsibility for that. Secretary Mattis and myself have both worked closely with the entire Saudi-led coalition to reduce the risk of civilian casualties and collateral damage. We’re all imperfect, but we’re working hard towards that end. Peace in Yemen is important, and if Iran would cease arming the Houthis and firing missiles out of Yemen into the Gulf states, we’d be a lot closer to that peace.


QUESTION: I know time is short. Before you go – and you’re going on in a few hours to the Value Voters Summit – and speaking about American values, the President today has tweeted that if the attack against the accuser of Judge Kavanaugh were as serious as she says it is, that she should have reported it back 36 years ago when she was 15 years old. Is that the American value that we should be teaching our women?


SECRETARY POMPEO: I’m going to be talking today about religious freedom, the fundamental values that are enshrined in our Constitution. With respect to the confirmation process for Judge Kavanaugh, I regret that this arose at the end. This was unfortunately sat on by a United States senator for weeks, as best I understand that, when there were confirmation hearings, a chance for Judge Kavanaugh to explain himself to them in private settings and in public settings, and instead a United States senator chose not to undertake that. I regret that. I think it’s unfortunate. I think the President has said pretty clearly we hope the process will move forward fairly and efficiently, and I’m pretty focused on making sure that American foreign policy is executed in a way that keeps Americans safe.


QUESTION: Well, thank you, sir, and we look forward to next week at the UN.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Thank you, Andrea. Good to see you.


QUESTION: You too.

"September 21, 2018","
QUESTION: You may have been told, Mr. Secretary, that I want to mostly focus on North Korea, but just a quick question about the latest news: We understand that the Security Council meeting next week is about nonproliferation. The President had just tweeted that he’s going to chair a meeting on Iran. So what’s the meeting about?


SECRETARY POMPEO: So Iran will certainly be a topic. The meeting is on a broader set of nonproliferation issues, but the world should know Iran leads the charge when it comes to the risk of proliferation. They continue to be the world’s largest state sponsor of terror and they continue the programs that have threatened the world for so long. The President’s determined to push back against them, and the meeting that he will chair next week will be centered on ensuring that nonproliferation is at the top of the world’s agenda.


QUESTION: So let’s talk about North Korea. There have been developments this week. Kim Jong-un has said he’s ready for rapid denuclearization, but as you know, he first wants the U.S. to declare a formal end to the Korea War. South Korean president has said that’s a good idea. Is the U.S. prepared to do that?


SECRETARY POMPEO: So I’ve been great about this: I’m not going to talk about the negotiations, where they stand, give any details that we choose not to make public. But I think it’s important for the world to remember: This is a country that threatened the world with nuclear weapons and missile systems. The world then made a decision to vote a set of UN Security Council resolutions that mandated the denuclearization of North Korea. The two leaders met, and Chairman Kim promised President Trump that he would do it, and my task and the task of others is to ensure that we implement the agreement from Singapore. 


QUESTION: So Kim Jong-un wants another summit with Mr. Trump. What does he have to do to get it?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Yeah, I mean, I think it’s fine. The two leaders are going to have to make lots of things happen. They’re the decision makers in each of the two countries. I’m going to travel to Pyongyang before too long if everything falls in place and schedules all work. We’ll continue to work to solve this vexing problem. And then the two leaders will continue to build upon the negotiations that are had at other levels and through other channels.


QUESTION: So it’s in the works?


SECRETARY POMPEO: It’s in the works. We’re hoping everything falls together and it makes good sense here before too terribly long.


QUESTION: Given the way that things are moving, do you think you can say that there’s no longer a nuclear threat from North Korea?


SECRETARY POMPEO: No, there’s still a threat. We still have work to do. But the good news is the threat is reduced from where it was. No test and no missile launches. To complete out a nuclear program, any good engineer will tell you you have to conduct tests, you still – there’s work to do. When we took office, the world was closer to war with North Korea than it is today. That’s a big step forward. But we’re going to keep the economic sanctions in place until such time as North Korea is fully and verifiably denuclearized. That’s the agenda that President Trump has set out, it’s what he agreed to with Chairman Kim, and we’re on our way to achieving that end state.


QUESTION: He has set out the agenda, but of course it was he who tweeted that there was no longer nuclear threat from North Korea.


SECRETARY POMPEO: I know the tweet very well. The President was saying that the risk is reduced, that the effort that North Korea had been engaged in to rapidly seek to perfect their missile system and their weapons system, their nuclear weapons system, that risk had been greatly reduced as a result of the efforts that this President undertook.


QUESTION: But by expressing his views in real time publicly – everyone can see them – doesn’t he – isn’t there a danger that he gives away the game? I mean, it seems as if Kim Jong-un has picked up on that. He gets ahead of the policymaking. That’s the view of allies, anyway.


SECRETARY POMPEO: That’s not what the allies tell me. Let’s step back just one moment. Whatever means, whatever modalities this administration has used to achieve the denuclearization of North Korea, it has proven more effective than at any time in America’s history. So one can critique my style, the President’s style, our different modes of operating. This much we can say: For the first time yesterday, a North Korean party paper talked about denuclearization and a peaceful, denuclearized Korean Peninsula. That’s just one example of the progress that we have made today. So I’m very proud of what we’ve done and the means by which we have done it. I think President Trump is putting us in a position to get to the end that the world so richly deserves.


QUESTION: You haven’t been tempted to take any documents off his table, have you?


SECRETARY POMPEO: I find that question offensive; I truly do. I’ve worked with this President closely, perhaps as closely as any other cabinet member. I briefed him almost every day as CIA director. This is a President who is thoughtful, who takes information, who deliberates, who asks hard questions and tosses out ideas about how we might think about things differently. No, I’m working diligently to deliver the foreign policy that President Trump is setting forth for America. It’s a challenge. The previous administration left the world in a dangerous place. Leading from behind has real consequences and our allies knew that, and they are thankful for the new approach that President Trump has brought to American foreign policy. 


QUESTION: You mentioned your position as the CIA director. In order to do a deal, you’ll need to know when Kim Jong-un is lying. How will you know that?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Yeah, I’m not going to talk about what we know or don’t know. The best way to know if we’re at the end is what we’ve talked about, verification, right? This is the sine qua non of the end of the discussion. It’s when we can fully verify that the North Korean peninsula – the North Korean country has made the strategic decision to take all of their nuclear weapons program and stand down. And at that time, sanctions will be relieved and as President Trump has said, there’ll be a true brighter future for North Korea and its people.


QUESTION: Mr. Pompeo, thank you very much for speaking with us.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Thank you very much. It was great to be with you. Good to see you.

QUESTION: Mr. Secretary, thank you for joining us.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Elise, it’s great to be with you. 


QUESTION: Let’s start with North Korea. You said yesterday you’re going to begin negotiations with the North Koreans, and you’ll be meeting with your foreign minister colleague up in New York. But how much do you think ultimately a deal with North Korea is going to end on the relationship between President Trump and Kim Jong-un?


SECRETARY POMPEO: So that relationship is certainly very important, as is the relationship between Chairman Kim and President Moon. They had their inter-Korean summit this past week where they made incremental progress, good stuff. President Trump has always known that we needed first to stop their testing of their nuclear weapon systems as well as their missiles – we’ve accomplished that – and then the process of full denuclearization can begin to take place. So we’re working on that. There have been lots of conversations, lots of work, lots of negotiation at multiple levels. But your point, that the two leaders will ultimately have to finish this thing off, close this deal, is certainly the case.


QUESTION: Is the President allowing Kim Jong-un to set the pace and scope, knowing that he made these commitments, and trust that he’ll make that decision ultimately?


SECRETARY POMPEO: We knew the pace would be uneven, but that progress each and every day was important. We think we’re getting that. Remember, the sanctions remain in place – the world’s sanctions, not America’s sanctions. The UN Security Council resolutions demand that Chairman Kim make this decision to denuclearize, and those sanctions and the enforcement of those sanctions will continue until such time as that occurs. That’s the important element that is different from what previous negotiators have done. We’ve always, in America, handed him a pile of money, or his father a pile of money, and said, “We hope you’ll denuclearize.” Our approach is different. It is to continue to enforce the sanctions until such time as we get to the end of the process.


QUESTION: Okay, let’s move to Iran, and particularly Iraq and Syria. You’ve had two attacks by Iranian-backed militias in U.S. diplomatic facilities in Iraq. The U.S. has said that it’s going to make sure all Iranian troops are going to leave Syria and is willing to stay the course. Are we headed towards a confrontation with Iran?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Well, Iran has been confronting the world as the world’s largest state sponsor of terror for quite some time.


QUESTION: It seems there was an escalation, though.


SECRETARY POMPEO: They have armed militias – the Lebanese Hizballah, Kata'ib Hizballah, and militias in Iraq. They’re arming the Houthis in Yemen, launching missiles into the Gulf states. The United States has begun to apply economic and diplomatic pressure on Iran to prevent them from doing this. That’s our mission. And it is true, Elise, we have told the Islamic Republic of Iran that using a proxy force to attack an American interest will not prevent us from responding against the prime actor. That is, we will not let Iran get away with using a proxy force to attack an American interest. Iran will be held accountable for those incidents.


QUESTION: Even militarily?


SECRETARY POMPEO: They’re going to be held accountable. If they’re responsible for the arming and training of these militias, we’re going to go to the source.


QUESTION: And you criticized Secretary of State John Kerry, former Secretary Kerry, for his meetings with Iran, saying he needs to get off the stage. But can you tell me, how is this jeopardizing your efforts right now?


SECRETARY POMPEO: No American – and in particular no former Secretary of State – should be actively seeking to undermine the foreign policy of the United States of America. You know, frankly, this was Secretary Kerry’s problem. He always refused to treat our enemies like enemies. And here he is today as the former Secretary of State telling our adversaries – the world’s largest state sponsor of terror, people who are conducting assassination attempts in Europe – just wait out this administration, giving foreign policy advice directly contrary to what President Trump is trying to achieve on behalf of America.


QUESTION: Is it working, though? Is it working?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Every American – especially former secretary of states – should be advocating for America’s foreign policy. It’s that straightforward.


QUESTION: The President said last night, Mr. Secretary, that – and again this morning that key allies are worried about the declassification of these – some of these Russia documents. Why are they concerned? Who’s concerned? And didn’t you, when you were CIA director, anticipate this might happen?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Well, I’ll leave to the Intelligence Community and the FBI and Justice Department to make the decisions about particular documents. I’m frankly not familiar with the contents of them, but I’ll say this: I am very confident that this administration won’t do a single thing which will put at risk a source, a method, our partners around the world. We haven’t done so to date, and I am very confident that President Trump and our team won’t do so in the future.


QUESTION: Do you think this is all a witch hunt, this Mueller probe, as the President has said?


SECRETARY POMPEO: I have been clear since I was first in front of the Senate for my confirmation hearing as the CIA director that we understand that there are many countries attempting to undermine American democracy and Western values, and that in 2016 – and frankly, in elections before that – the Russians attempted to interfere in our election. I would add to that list in 2018, and perhaps in 2020 as well, China, Iran, North Korea, nonstate actors, each of whom has an interest in trying to undermine Western democracy, especially here in the United States. We are working our tails off to prevent them from having any impact on any election anywhere in the United States.


QUESTION: Bob Woodward in his book suggested that the President felt that this Russia probe is weakening him and U.S. diplomacy. Have you found that in your meetings?


SECRETARY POMPEO: I have found that moving away from leading from behind has been welcomed by the world. The partners I met when the CIA director, and just this week I met with another half a dozen, they understand that America is back, we are engaged, we are leading from a core set of principles that they all can rally around and begin to help us build coalitions to solve some of the most difficult problems facing this world that were left with us – left to us by the previous administration.


QUESTION: The Woodward book describes a President who doesn’t understand national security, a cabinet that is moving things around to save the country from the President’s national security. Have you seen that, and do you do that?


SECRETARY POMPEO: I find that absolutely ludicrous. There is – I mean, I’ll be careful. There aren’t many members of the President’s cabinet who have spent as much time with him as I have. I briefed him almost every day as CIA director. I see him and talk to him every day now. This is a President who is fully informed, well briefed, listens, asks hard questions, and is leading his foreign policy team towards solving so many of the problems that plague this world. I wish the previous administration had acted with such diligence and power, but it was left to us. We’ll get it right.

QUESTION: Mr. Secretary, you just – first of all, thank you very much.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Rich, it’s great to be with you.


QUESTION: And you revealed that North Korea has agreed to a deadline of 2021. What do you and what does the United States need to see by the end of this year?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Yeah. Well, look, we’re not going to set arbitrary deadlines in the interim. We’re hoping to see progress a little bit each day. We knew this would be a long process. It’s a complicated endeavor. But we’ve made incremental steps along the way. The visit from President Moon, the visits between the two leaders and Chairman Kim is historic. It’s the first time the North and the South have spoken about denuclearization in a material way. And they made a little bit of progress. I’m hoping I’ll be back in Pyongyang before too long to make some more progress; and if that’s the case, I’m very hopeful that Chairman Kim and President Trump will get a chance to meet in the near future as well.


QUESTION: And President Moon has suggested or said that Chairman Kim would like to meet with the President. Have those plans already started? Is the administration already discussing a meeting with Chairman Kim?


SECRETARY POMPEO: So we’re working on it, but there’s still a little bit of work to do left to make sure that the conditions are right and that the two leaders are put in a position where we can make substantial progress.


QUESTION: And that comes with your conversations with the North Koreans that you’re having?


SECRETARY POMPEO: That’s right. There’s lots of conversations taking place across many different forums and venues, lots of discussions about how to move forward, what are the right sets of next steps. But the end that we can’t lose focus on, there are two UN Security Council resolutions that the whole world voted on, and they require the North Koreans to fully denuclearize. That’s the mission statement. That’s the President’s objective. And we believe that we can achieve that before too terribly long.


QUESTION: On Iran, Germany’s foreign minister has suggested that Europe should work around the U.S. dollar. Russian companies are trying to do the same. Is there a risk to the dominance of the U.S. dollar as these countries try to evade U.S. sanctions?


SECRETARY POMPEO: The Islamic Republic of Iran continues to be the world’s largest state sponsor of terror. We are determined to stop that behavior and to change the way the Iranian regime inflicts horrors all around the world. A good piece of that was the President’s decision to withdraw from the JCPOA, which to him and to me made no sense whatsoever, to begin to reimpose costs on Iran so that they don’t have the wealth, the contacts around the world, and the capacity to inflict harm on the American people and others around the world. We’re looking for our European partners to join us, but we have a big coalition that understands that these sanctions make sense and will continue to assist us in enforcing them.


QUESTION: Are the European countermeasures effective, though? Are they blunting U.S. policy?


SECRETARY POMPEO: If you just watch the traffic, it’s one-way. Folks are leaving Iran, including European businesses. And so I am very confident that we will ultimately be effective in enforcing the sanctions that President Trump has asked us to reimpose. 


QUESTION: On Turkey, Pastor Brunson is still there. Have there been any productive conversations with the Turkish Government in the last couple of weeks to get him out?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Conversations, great frequency, multiple levels. I can’t comment on any particular details, only this: We have made clear that Pastor Brunson and the others that the Turkish Government is holding with no basis for having detained them need to come home.


QUESTION: Are you confident that – or that there’s – that you’re actually making progress with the Turkish Government?


SECRETARY POMPEO: I don’t want to say anything more. I’m very hopeful that we will achieve resolution on this before too long. 


QUESTION: On Venezuela, the State Department says it supports the Venezuelan people. Maduro is still there. The country’s economic situation continues to deteriorate. Is the U.S. prepared to move to a different phase in its interaction or in its engagement with Venezuela to try to resolve what’s happening there?


SECRETARY POMPEO: I think you’ll see in the coming days a series of actions that continue to increase the pressure level against the Venezuelan leadership – folks who are working directly against the best interests of the Venezuelan people.


QUESTION: Is that sanctions?


SECRETARY POMPEO: It’s remarkable – I don’t want to get ahead of the administration on decisions like that. But it’s always remarkable when I interact with those who know Venezuela best. This is a country with the capacity for great wealth and great opportunity to take good care of their people. They are not a country that is starved of resources. And yet this regime of Maduro has caused such pain and hardship, but now real humanitarian risk and refugees traveling all throughout South and Central America. We are determined to ensure that the Venezuelan people get their say.


QUESTION: Is the only way that that happens for Maduro to leave?


SECRETARY POMPEO: However it happens is the outcome that will be chosen by the Venezuelan people, and I think they understand that Maduro has not been someone who has taken care to ensure that the best interests of the Venezuelan people are actually reflected in their governmental policies. 


QUESTION: So he should leave?


SECRETARY POMPEO: I’ll leave that to the Venezuelan people.


QUESTION: On China, is the Chinese Government already interfering in U.S. politics? I know the National Security Advisor had mentioned that that is the case. And does the United States have more to worry about on that front – election interference – from the Chinese Government than it does from Russia, let’s say?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Rich, we worry about election interference from lots of places, certainly from China. We’ve seen what the Russians did back in 2016, and frankly, we know what the Russians have done for decades now. But it’s not simply Russia and China. North Korea too has a great capacity to do things in the cyber world that could have an impact on our elections. Iran, too. There are multiple countries – and frankly, nonstate actors as well. DHS, FBI, our Intelligence Community, the State Department where we have a role as well, is involved in making sure that the elections that, frankly, start in just a few days – folks will start voting here in the United States before too long.


QUESTION: And the U.S. is prepared?


SECRETARY POMPEO: I think we’re – I think we are in a place that we have never been before in terms of our preparedness.


QUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Secretary.

SECRETARY POMPEO: Good afternoon. That is an unbelievably warm welcome. It is wonderful to see so many patriots here who carry the torch of freedom forward. Thank you all for being here.


	It was great, I heard Tony say too – I was glad, it sounded like there were a few more Marines than Army guys here. (Laughter.) But I am so privileged to have the opportunity to be here. There were some folks who didn’t want me to come here today. I don’t know if any of you read about that. But it seems to me only natural that an American Secretary of State would come to talk to you about America’s values and interests. And I know that religious freedom is important to each of you, and it’s important for me to be here today to talk to you.


	Thanks, Tony, for your kind introduction and for the opportunity to speak here today. I’ve known Tony as a fierce, courageous defender of America’s essential freedoms, the thing that I do now each and every day as a Secretary of State. And I didn’t know that Tony had a connection to the State Department until I was preparing for this. A few years ago, he was part of our Anti-Terrorism Assistance Program. And someone said that the dark was scared of him; I hope the terrorists were scared of him, too. (Laughter.) Thank you, Tony, for your important work.


	This State Department under President Trump is fighting to make sure that American citizens and American interests come first in our foreign policy. (Applause.)


	At the very heart of our mission is the preservation of human dignity. And this administration understands an eternal truth – that each person has an essential worth simply because he or she is human and having been created by God. And our Declaration of Independence enshrines that self-evident truth – we all know this – that each of us is endowed by our Creator with inalienable rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.


	Whenever I say that, I am always reminded when I taught fifth-grade Sunday school with my wife, Susan, we were teaching them about faith, but we were talking about religious freedom in America and how we were so blessed to be able to go to that church and worship. And I talked to them, and I read that phrase to them, and one of the little fifth-grade boys raised his hand and said, “I especially like that pursuit of happiness part.” (Laughter.)


	These ideas come from our unwavering belief in the inalienable rights. It’s what makes America so exceptional, so free, so prosperous – the greatest nation in the history of the world. Our calling as Americans is to preserve that, to protect it, to keep that ancient spark of wisdom in the laws of our own republic, and to do so as best we can all around the world.


	President Trump, in a remarkable speech he gave in Warsaw, Poland, said that, “Above all, we value the dignity of every human life, we protect the rights of every person, and we share the hope of every soul to live in freedom.”


	For Americans, that’s our birthright – freedom. But for many around the world, it’s an aspiration. And each of us can do many things to help fulfill that aspiration. I think that sometimes here in America we take it for granted. Those of us who are believers don’t see that in so many places in the world that simple thing, that belief that we have, is challenged. And I urge each of you never to hide it under a bushel, to understand – to understand how important it is that we speak about this, we speak about faith and freedom in a way that is candid and clear, and the best of what America has to offer.


	When I came to the State Department, I talked about “swagger” and the State Department getting its swagger back. It’s been mocked a little bit – indeed, by Kanye West. He had a song or something. I’m pretty unfamiliar with that terrain. (Laughter.) But what I meant by that was what I just said. We have this incredible privilege to be citizens of the United States of America, to have the religious freedom and to build relationships around the world. It allows us to protect human dignity of our own people and advance it when that freedom is under assault.


	I want our diplomats, those diplomats who are tasked with representing you all around the world, I want them to comfortably, unapologetically, and respectfully advance American ideals and interests in every corner of the world. (Applause.) And you should know that because we believe these principles are worth living by, we proudly raise our banner of self-government, freedom, and human dignity all across the world. We’ll never accept a diminished role for America on the global stage. We’re going to lead from the front. (Applause.)


	Now, it’s a little different from when I was a soldier. I am now a diplomat. I think you can see the change already. (Laughter.) Yes, you laughed just exactly right there. (Laughter.) My team, my diplomatic team, has responsibility on a couple of fronts. I want to talk to you about them. First is we need to make sure that America prospers here at home, so the work that we do abroad should be designed to support President Trump’s efforts to make sure that America’s economy is strong.


	We all know that human dignity depends on work, and the opportunity to work is something that the State Department has a role in to bring people to America, to invest, to help create and grow this remarkable economy that is ours here in the United States. The Trump administration fights for jobs at home because we know that the ability of every man and woman to put their hand to labor is not just a matter for their pocket books. It’s about human dignity and pride.


	We also know – and this is what I want to focus on today – that we are ensuring human dignity by advancing one of our most cherished and indispensable liberties. It’s enshrined in the First Amendment. It is our religious freedom. Since the earliest days of his presidency, President Trump has directed all of us in his administration to advance and defend religious freedom at home and abroad, because religious freedom is a universal, a God-given right, to which all people – all people – are entitled. (Applause.)


	It is – religious freedom is also an essential building block for all free societies, and our founders knew this. It’s a freedom that I care personally about, and I know you do as well. It’s the one that drew me to serve my country in the United States Armed Forces. But sadly, today more than 80 percent of the global population lives in countries that place significant limitations on religious freedom. And I know it brings many of us heavy hearts to watch the ongoing persecution of Christians and other minorities in countries like the Islamic Republic of Iran. We are fighting for human dignity of the Iranian people by speaking the truth about the oppressive and corrupt regime that controls those people. Religious minorities in Iran are routinely imprisoned, stripped of their rights, kicked out of their jobs, and subject to many other abuses.


	Earlier this year – I’m sure some of you saw this – there was a moving news segment on 20 Iranian Christians who made a dangerous journey outside of Iran to an undisclosed location. After years of gathering in secret, all they wanted was to spend a few days in a place, in a place where they could conduct a baptism ceremony without fear of reprisal. And so 20 of them secretly flew to a foreign country and rented a hotel swimming pool for some baptisms. One man said he had waited 10 years since his conversion for this very moment. This is the level of secrecy needed to be a Christian inside of Iran.


	I could give you many more examples, examples of how Iranian people have been mistreated by a repressive, corrupt, and hypocritical regime for 40 years. As part of a larger persecution of the Sunni minority last year, one court sentenced four Sunnis to five years imprisonment for the crime of jogging, of all things. A Sufi Muslim man was hanged in June after a sham judicial process.


	After President Trump withdrew from the flawed deal, he implemented a new strategy to force a change in the Iranian regime’s behavior. And part of this strategy is to make sure that the voices inside Iran crying out for accountability, justice, and religious freedom know that the United States stands with them. We stand with the Christians, the Jews, the Sufis, the Muslims, the Zoroastrians, the Baha’i, and all other faith groups in Iran who have had their human dignity violated by this regime. We know the importance of God-given right of all people to worship according to their conscience.


	Another example is in China. Hundreds of thousands, and possibly millions, of Uighurs are held against their will in so-called re-education camps, where they’re forced to endure severe political indoctrination and other awful abuses. Their religious beliefs are decimated. And we’re concerned too about the intense new government crackdown on Christians in China, which includes heinous actions like closing churches, burning bibles, and ordering followers to sign papers renouncing their faith.


	One of the most important things I think I can do in my role as Secretary of State is to speak to these issues. Tony referred to the first-ever Religious Freedom Ministerial that we held at the State Department.


	Now, if you’re like me, you don’t know what a ministerial is. (Laughter.) Two years ago, I probably could not have told you. Let me try it this way. When I was a deacon at my church back home, if we were trying to confront a problem, we held a meeting. That’s what – it’s just a meeting. (Laughter.) But it was an important meeting. It was a meeting where representatives from over 80 countries attended a unique event to stand with the United States in our cause of defending the rights of all individuals to worship how they choose and believe what and how they want.


	We let the world know that religious freedom mattered and that it is a fundamental human right, and the United States would expect them to honor that.


	I must say, when the meeting kicked off, I didn’t know exactly what to expect, but the response – the pent-up demand for this opportunity – was so overwhelming that we’re going to do it again next year. (Applause.) It – I hope it will become a tradition that is honored by decades of happening, and I hope to attend the 30th, 40th, and 50th ministerial. (Applause.)


	We truly do. We envision this becoming – we envision this becoming a landmark gathering for the world. We didn’t just talk; we came up with plans, we helped countries that were challenged to set up institutions where religious freedom would be talked about and discussed, and if they were a little further along, to help them continue to develop that inside their own country. And most of all, we wanted to do this to set an example. It’s what the State Department can do best in representing each of you all around the world, making this nation the continued beacon – the beacon that says one’s right to worship their god is a fundamental freedom that every human being has and that America values this and will demand it.


	We’re confident that our progress will continue because the State Department has been a lifelong champion for religious liberty. We’re blessed now to be quarterbacked by a good friend of mine – two Kansans now – Senator Sam Brownback, leading our religious freedom efforts. (Applause.)


	As I close today, a couple thoughts. I want to tell you a final quick story about how we’re ensuring human dignity – by working to bring home Americans that have been unjustly held captive by other nations.


	Far and away the greatest highlight to date of my job as Secretary of State was bringing home three Americans from captivity in North Korea. (Applause.) Thank you. Thank you.


	It – it’s emotional still to speak about it. When Kim Dong-chul, Kim Hak-song, and Tony Kim got off our plane at about 2:30 a.m. at Andrews Air Force Base, their faces were bursting with tears of joy. They hugged and they wept with their families. And President Trump was on the tarmac to meet them. (Applause.)


	I remember – I remember the trip well. I remember our – my hope and my prayers that we would be able to deliver these people home, and when they arrived at the airport, I was already aboard the plane and I saw them get out of the vehicle and they could walk and they appeared to be in reasonably good health. I wasn’t emotionally prepared for the moment, and even now as I speak out it – speak about it, it reminds me of the greatness of our nation.


	On that flight, they scribbled out a note and you can see it if you go back and look at the video. One of them – one of the men handed me a little note card and I put it in my vest pocket as they were climbing down the stairway. As I got home that night with Susan, I pulled it out and on it – on that index card was Psalm 126, and it read as follows:


	“When the Lord brought back the captives to Zion, we were like men who dreamed. Our mouths were filled with laughter, our tongues with songs of joy. Then it was said among the nations, ‘The Lord has done great things for them.’ The Lord has done great things for us, and we are filled with joy.” (Applause.)


	Even as we sit here today in this beautiful hall, there are thousands of Christians and people of other faiths in North Korea and around the world like Kim Dong-chul who are praying for deliverance from captivity and from fear of persecution.


	His deliverance gives us hope and energizes our prayers that all those mistreated for their faith around the world will endure and one day be free.


	His story fuels the Trump administration’s commitment to protect human dignity by ensuring that all those with the fire of faith in their hearts to be able to exercise their God-given rights.


	There’s another man you’ve likely heard of, Pastor Brunson. Let me say right now here we are sparing no effort to return Pastor Brunson home to the United States. The work is important. (Applause.) He – the work is important. He has been wrongly held, and his proper place is to be able to return here to once again practice his faith in our great nation. (Applause.)


	Know that – know this: President Trump will never forget about our own, and that is one of the greatest American values of all.


	On the day Pastor Brunson returns, just like the men I spoke of a bit ago, they also will be able to say that “the Lord has done great things for us,” and again our hearts will be filled with joy.


	Thank you. May God bless you all. (Applause.)

	On this day of reflection, thanksgiving, and family, we are reminded of the strength of the U.S.-Republic of Korea Alliance that is based on our shared values of democracy and human rights and shared interests of security and economic prosperity.


	I wish everyone in Korea the best on this Chuseok holiday.

	I am proud that one of America’s greatest qualities is our steadfast generosity and willingness to welcome families who have faced circumstances most of us cannot fathom, including war and ethnic cleansing. Refugees are among the world’s most vulnerable people, and America has embraced about 3 million of them since 1980.


	Every year, the U.S. government must determine the number of refugees we can admit into the country. The process requires comprehensive and time-consuming background checks and other security measures. This week, after consulting with other federal agencies, the Department of State proposed resettling as many as 30,000 refugees in the U.S.


	In addition to refugee cases, a backlog of 800,000 people seeking asylum — another way the U.S. offers protection — already exists in our system, leaving many families in legal limbo for years. We anticipate an additional 280,000 people in the next year will seek this kind of protection. Each of these cases must be carefully decided, and we are more determined than ever to resolving them in a timely manner.


	America’s commitment to the most vulnerable also extends well beyond our immigration system. We are putting a new focus on increasing assistance to refugees and other displaced people as close to their home countries as possible. We can house, feed and provide medical care for hundreds of thousands more refugees closer to their homes, and do so more rapidly, than we could possibly do here in the U.S. We are also prioritizing the safe and voluntary return of refugees to their home countries when conditions permit — a solution that most refugees prefer.


	President Donald Trump pledged to keep the American people safe by more carefully vetting those who want to come to our country, while also prioritizing processing cases of those who are already here. I believe we can achieve the ideal of continuing to assist the world’s most vulnerable people without losing sight of our first duty: serving the American people. We are, and continue to be, the most generous nation in the world.

"September 19, 2018","
QUESTION: Mr. Secretary, thanks so much for joining us tonight. We really, really appreciate it.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Laura, it’s great to be with you.


QUESTION: Iran in the news. Brian Hook, your special envoy, saying: We want to deal with Iran, but a treaty with Iran. Iranian leaders: No go. They’re like: We don’t want any dealings with the United States at this point. What’s going on?


SECRETARY POMPEO: President Trump’s been very clear since the time he was running for office that the arrangement that the previous administration put in place was bad for America, frankly, bad for the world. And so I and Brian are working to get Iran to behave like a normal nation, right, stop being the world’s largest state sponsor of terror, stop launching missiles through proxies, stop attacking our embassies and consulates. When we get those basic things in place, President Trump’s made very clear we’d love Iran to rejoin the community of nations, but their revolutionary zeal causes them to be a bad actor and they need to shape up. And if they do, we’ll get it right.


QUESTION: Well, again, you and John Kerry have gone back and forth on this – former Secretary of State, Barack Obama – has met four times with Iranian leadership, and you guys criticized, saying that’s not appropriate given – it’s – you can’t have two-track foreign policy here. But he responded by saying “there’s nothing unusual, let alone unseemly or inappropriate, about former diplomats meeting with foreign counterparts.” Secretary of State Kissinger’s done it for decades with Russia and China. “What is unseemly and unprecedented… for the podium of the State Department to be hijacked for political theatrics.”


SECRETARY POMPEO: Secretary Kerry can’t seem to get off the stage, and you have to. When I’m the former Secretary, I’ll get off. Every previous former secretary’s done that too. It’s one thing to meet with your counterpart; it’s another thing to do what Secretary Kerry, Wendy Sherman, Ernest Moniz, frankly the whole gang has done, which is to actively seek to undermine what President Trump is trying to achieve. It’s okay to talk with them, but you have to be working for America, working for American foreign policy, and they’re not. They’re working for the foreign policy that is theirs, not the one that belongs to the United States.


QUESTION: Our own Dana Perino last week had Kerry on, and he did not deny that he wanted to basically tell the Iranians – whether he told the – to wait it out for the next administration. And he said everybody around the world is trying to wait this out. At what point does the administration pursue some type of legal action against former Secretary Kerry and others from the former administration?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Well, I’ll leave the legal action to others. I’m trying to execute America’s foreign policy, and they are not only unhelpful, but they are acting in ways that are harmful to achieving what’s best for the American people, and that’s my criticism. Stop it. Let it go. You had your day. We think you fundamentally got it wrong with Iran, and we’re trying to make it right for America.


QUESTION: And reducing the refugee number, that’s caused great consternation. It’s another issue that President Trump campaigned on: extreme vetting, security for our country. Down to 30,000 next fiscal year. Bob Menendez, big fan of the administration, called it “cruel and shortsighted.” Human Rights First, another group: It’s an “abdication,” Mr. Secretary, “of our humanity.” Your response?


SECRETARY POMPEO: America’s the most generous nation in the history of civilization. It always has been and it continues to be under President Trump. We want to get it right for the American people. We’ve taken in over 4 million legal permanent residents in the last almost two decades now. We continue to take in more people than most countries in the rest of the world, but we got to get the security piece right. We’ve got to make sure that we allow those who are in most trouble, most harm’s way to be taken care of in the best place to take care of them, near their own country. Those are – those are not heartless things. Those are things that are kind and caring and decent. It’s the way we ought to treat our fellow human beings, and it’s what we in the Trump administration are committing to do.


QUESTION: What does our – this administration say to the Christian refugees who feel many of them abandoned in the – for many years predating this administration in Syria, in Iraq, and beyond? They can’t go to these camps because they’re afraid of going to the camps. How do we reach them? How do we get some of them into the country?


SECRETARY POMPEO: So it’s an important and difficult challenge. We want to bring in all those who are most in trouble and are having the most difficulty in the places in which they reside. Vice President Pence has made this a real priority, to ensure that Christians are being treated fairly and equitably in our processes. We’ve seen some of these issues in these camps. Rest assured that the State Department’s working to make sure that Christians are not being mistreated, prosecuted, persecuted, or treated in any way that’s unfair as they try to make their way into the United States of America.


QUESTION: The U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom lists China and Saudi Arabia right in – well, one, and I think Saudi Arabia is number three – of the worst violators of human rights. I was thinking about this yesterday, because you think of the old Soviet Union and President Reagan, who both of us admire so much; we didn’t do that, really heavily engage trade with the Soviet Union – not just because of nukes, but because of what they were doing on human rights. So how do we justify this huge trading relationship with Saudi Arabia and China given how we treat, then, North Korea and a place like Cuba? It seems like there’s selective treatment of human rights violations.


SECRETARY POMPEO: So it’s always the case when you’re trying to advocate for America’s interests that you have to weigh the relative concerns, and it is the case that each country presents its own situation. What I think we’ve been incredibly consistent on is making sure that we identify, we call out these concerns. I’ve done it with respect to China, I’ve done it with respect to every place we find religious minorities being mistreated. We held the first-ever religious ministerial in the very room in which we’re sitting here. It was quite an occasion – people from nearly every religion and 80 delegations. This administration is taking religious freedom all around the world, in China and other places, very seriously.


QUESTION: A million Muslims in China --


SECRETARY POMPEO: Yes.


QUESTION: -- are being detained; Christian churches, crosses being smashed; churches driven underground; pastors being imprisoned. And we have to talk about my good friend, President Xi. It’s just – it’s heartbreaking to so many of us who care about religious liberty. And I know this is an administration priority, but what do you do? What leverage do we have with China at this point other than what we’re doing now with trade?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Laura, I’m confident we’ll talk about China in other contexts too. It presents a myriad of opportunities, but lots of challenges. You speak of one. This is a nontransparent government. It is still a very centralized government. It treats our intellectual property horribly, it treats its religious minorities horribly. In each of these cases, we have opportunities. You’ve seen what the President’s doing with trade, to try and make it fair and reciprocal. What we’re asking of China is to behave in a way that if they want to be a power, if they want to be on the global stage, they have to operate in a way that global leaders have for so often. And frankly, as you point out in the religious dimension, they’ve not done that.


QUESTION: We talk a lot about big tech and the relationship between big tech and this administration, whether it’s adversarial. But Google specifically in China, assisting Google and developing an app to further censor free expression and the ability of Chinese citizens to get information – any thoughts on that, how a U.S. company – obviously, huge global company too – assists China in that oppression of free expression?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Laura, it is personally and professionally troubling to me when American companies behave one way here and another way when they’re dealing with China. It gets at the core problem that President Trump is trying to address, which is that China doesn’t permit American investors to invest on the same terms that Chinese companies can invest here, joint ventures. The list is long of the non-reciprocal relationship. The President’s trying to balance that. And when we get that right, when government gets that right, we can then force American companies to behave under that set of rules.


	I want every company, including global giants, to treat American citizens as well as they treat the governments of some of these despotic regimes.


QUESTION: And yet they hit the administration, President Trump, the day after – a couple days after the election. You’ve got Sergey Brin up there. Again, brilliant guy, brilliant people, but criticizing this administration’s immigration policy when they’re assisting despotic – basically, obviously communist regimes overseas. But Trump’s the threat?


SECRETARY POMPEO: I think we have American foreign policy on the right track on each of the dimensions that you’re describing. And when we get it right, when we ultimately see the end result of President Trump’s efforts, I see – I think you’ll see many of these things in a place that America’s not seen before. They’re going to be a great thing for the country.


QUESTION: We’ll leave China in just a moment, but the South China Sea, I think it’s an underreported story. I know you just met with the leadership from the Philippines here. They were talking to China about some type of agreement. Real concerns about that, that trading path – $3.3 trillion worth of goods go through the South China Sea, and China has very strong territorial ambitions to dominate it.


SECRETARY POMPEO: They do. This was a place that this administration found itself when it came in; China had advanced during the previous eight years dramatically throughout the South and East China Seas. I did have a chance to meet with some of the Philippine leadership today and share with them our concerns. I think they share them as well. They understand, as do all of the countries of Southeast Asia – they’d much rather deal with a United States and not be a vassal state for any other country.


	And so America needs to remain engaged. We have important interests in the region. And if we do that, I am confident not only will we push back in a way that’s appropriate to make sure that we have a free and fair and open Indo-Pacific, but those countries will benefit as well.


QUESTION: Russia versus China. There’s a lot of focus on Russia because of election meddling, threats of future election meddling, Ukraine, the relationship with Europe and trade and so forth. As you see things, who’s the bigger threat to the U.S. position in the world, economically, strategically, Russia or China?


SECRETARY POMPEO: I often get asked these prioritization questions and it always makes me a little bit queasy to answer them. They present such different concerns. To rank them, I think, sometimes is – sends the wrong message to the American people. Russia has been aggressive. Russia has tried to meddle in our election. Russia, under Vladimir Putin, remains a bully. We need to push back and constrain them where we can. But longer term, if you’re looking at the things that threaten American livelihoods, that put America truly at risk of its continued economic growth, China prevents the – presents the far greater threat to the United States.


QUESTION: There was concern from the foreign policy elites, Mr. Secretary, early on and expressed throughout this administration that, oh, the Trump team kind of bumbles through these events; they go out and promise a lot but then the deliverables aren’t there. Of course, they cite North Korea – North Korea is not denuclearizing at a pace that maybe we thought they would, and so forth. But what’s the real status with our relationship with Europe and our relationship with the North Korean leadership given how things have transpired?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Well, I’ll start with North Korea. We have made steady albeit slow progress, but it’s always – we’ve always known this was going to take some time. The South Koreans had a successful engagement – President Moon with Chairman Kim just over the last 48 hours – where we made another step, where we will get verification of an element of North Korea’s program on the ground. That’s a good thing. We’re moving forward. The relationship between Chairman Kim and President Trump is good. I talk to my counterparts there with some frequency. It doesn’t get reported. I’m glad about that; I’m glad we’re able to keep that quiet. And so we’re making the progress that we need.


	With respect to Europe, look, there was a reset that needed to take place in the relationship. We needed Europe to step forward and begin to share the burden of defense for the European countries in a way that they had not done under previous presidents. President Trump is trying to right that ship. We still have a fascinatingly important relationship with Europe, and I’m confident that that trans-Atlantic relationship will always remain.


QUESTION: Project Veritas, I’m sure you know, released this video of a State Department analyst kind of bragging about his exploits working for the Democratic Socialists of America, typing things after hours and so forth. But it’s a concern. Other videos coming out – DOJ employee, similarly part of the resistance, perhaps bragging about it. Does this portend more problems of a internal resistance to this administration? Are you concerned about it and what next in this investigation of this particular employee?


SECRETARY POMPEO: So, Laura, I can’t speak about the particular case, but rest assured we’re aware of it and we’re taking a good look at it. But step back for just a minute. Here’s my commitment to President Trump and to the American people: Every single person working at the United States Department of State will be on President Trump’s mission. We all have good ideas; we’ll all share them, we’ll give our best thoughts. But at the end of the day, we have a single foreign policy that we’re executing and it’s the foreign policy that President Trump is directing, and I want every person all across the United States Government to understand that he’s our leader and we all need to be on the team.


QUESTION: But they shouldn’t be in this administration. If they’re going to be working against the administration, they should go probably find another job, don’t you think? I mean --


SECRETARY POMPEO: Absolutely. If you – if this is a mission on which you can’t sign up for, it’s time to go do something else with your time. Thank you for your service, but we need to be delivering for this President.


QUESTION: Do you miss the CIA?


SECRETARY POMPEO: I loved my time at the CIA. I am loving my time here at the State Department as well.


QUESTION: Mr. Secretary, thanks so much --


SECRETARY POMPEO: Thank you. Thank you.


QUESTION: -- for being so generous with your time.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Thank you. Good luck to you.

SECRETARY POMPEO: Good afternoon, everyone. The United States anticipates processing up to 310,000 refugees and asylum seekers in Fiscal Year 2019. We propose resettling up to 30,000 refugees under the new refugee ceiling, as well as processing more than 280,000 asylum seekers. They will join the over 800,000 asylum seekers who are already inside the United States and who are awaiting adjudication of their claims. These expansive figures continue the United States’ longstanding record of the most generous nation in the world when it comes to protection-based immigration and assistance.


	Since 2000, over one and a half million people have been admitted as refugees or granted asylum in the United States of America. Since 2001, the U.S. has permanently admitted 4.1 million total lawful permanent residents from refugee-producing nations. A full measure of America’s protection-based immigration efforts also includes the hundreds of thousands of people who have received temporary and permanent humanitarian protection under other immigration categories such as victims of trafficking, humanitarian parole, temporary protected status, and special immigrant juveniles.


	In addition to the above efforts, the total U.S. humanitarian assistance worldwide was more than $8 billion in FY 2017, more than any other country. This year’s proposed refugee ceiling must be considered in the context of the many other forms of protection and assistance offered by the United States.


	Moreover, the refugee ceiling number should not be viewed in isolation from other expansive humanitarian programs. Some will characterize the refugee ceiling as the sole barometer of America’s commitment to vulnerable people around the world. This would be wrong.


	Other countries, when noting their humanitarian protection efforts, highlight their assistance to both refugees and asylees. The United States should do the same. This year’s refugee ceiling reflects the substantial increase in the number of individuals seeking asylum in our country, leading to a massive backlog of outstanding asylum cases and greater public expense. The daunting operational reality of addressing the over 800,000 individuals in pending asylum cases demands renewed focus and prioritization. The magnitude of this challenge is unequaled in any other country.


	In consideration of both U.S. national security interest and the urgent need to restore integrity to our overwhelmed asylum system, the United States will focus on addressing the humanitarian protection cases of those already in the country.


	This year’s refugee ceiling also reflects our commitment, our commitment to protect the most vulnerable around the world while prioritizing the safety and well-being of the American people, as President Trump has directed. We must continue to responsibly vet applicants to prevent the entry of those who might do harm to our country.


	Already this year, we have seen evidence that the system previously in place was defective. It allowed a foreign national to slip through who was later discovered to be a member of ISIS, as well as other individuals with criminal backgrounds. The American people must have complete confidence that everyone granted resettlement in our country is thoroughly vetted. The security checks take time, but they’re critical.


	The number of individuals forcibly displaced worldwide, over 68 million, vastly exceeds the number of individuals who could possibly be resettled or granted asylum status in host countries each year. It is therefore critical to make clear that our support for the most vulnerable extends well beyond America’s immigration system.


	As President Trump established in the National Security Strategy and in his speech last year at the United Nations General Assembly, we are maintaining our enduring humanitarian commitments by working to assist refugees and other displaced people as close to their home countries as possible, thereby increasing the number of displaced people who have received aid and protection.


	The United States is steadfast in prioritizing a course of action that enables the safe and voluntary return of refugees to their home countries if and when conditions permit – a solution that most refugees prefer. This strategy reflects our deep commitment to achieving optimal humanitarian outcomes. The best way to help most people is to promote burden sharing with partners and allies, to work to end conflicts that drive displacement in the first place, and to target the application of foreign aid in a smarter way.


	A focus on helping refugees overseas also allows us to maximize our resources. We can house, feed, and provide medical care for hundreds of thousands more refugees closer to their homes and do so more rapidly than we could possibly do here in the United States. The ultimate goal is the best possible care and safety of these people in need, and our approach is designed to achieve this noble objective.


	The improved refugee policy of this administration serves the national interest of the United States and expands our ability to help those in need all around the world. We will continue to assist the world’s most vulnerable while never losing sight of our first duty, serving the American people. We are, and continue to be, the most generous nation in the world.


	Thank you all for your attention.

SECRETARY POMPEO: Good afternoon, everyone.


QUESTION: Good afternoon.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Before I get started, I want to let our fellow Americans know who are affected by Hurricane Florence that our prayers are with them. I understand there may well have been loss of life. Our heart goes out to them. Thanks, too, to all the first responders, military, civilian and the like, who are doing such good work. The federal government’s help is there, and we still continue to encourage every American who’s in the threatened path to listen to government officials and take heed to their words.


	We’re also aware that there’s a typhoon in the Pacific Ocean right now which will take a toll on our friends in the Philippines. Our prayers are with them as well. State Department teams are ready to deliver the appropriate help to the region at the right time.


	As you all know, on Wednesday, President Trump signed an executive order that made clear that our administration will not tolerate foreign interference in our democratic processes. Elections are the foundation of our democracy, and preserving their integrity is a matter of protecting sovereignty and American national security.


	Foreign malicious actors have used information technology and social media to open new fronts in their efforts to undermine our democracy and our core institutions. These actors want to turn Americans against one another and convince us that our institutions, our ideals, are defective. But we are resolved to defeat these efforts and make clear that those who interfere with our liberties will pay a price.


	In the last few years, Russia has been particularly aggressive in using its cyber capabilities, disinformation, and other covert means to attempt to sow instability in America. As this executive order makes clear, if Russia or any other foreign government or persons acting on their behalf interfere in the United States election, there will be swift and severe consequences.


	The order provides for mandatory sanctions against foreign persons determined to have participated in interference in our elections. It also provides for additional measures that could be capable of devastating or interfering in our country’s economy. And if the government of that country authorized, directed, or sponsored, or supported election interference, we’re going to come after them.


	The State Department will continue to work closely with other agencies to identify, expose – and expose foreign interference directed against American elections, no matter which entity initiated it. We’ll also continue to work with our partners around the world to stand against these threats to democracy wherever – and however – they rear their head.


	I want to spend just a few minutes on this Friday afternoon talking about the team here at the State Department as well. Yesterday was a great day. It was a proud day. After Senate confirmation, President Trump conferred on four of our officers the position of Career Ambassador. Four of the State Department’s finest: Philip Goldberg, David Hale, my Under Secretary for Political Affairs Michele Sison, and Dan Smith.


	This is the highest and most prestigious rank at the Foreign Service. They should all be very proud. I know I’m proud of them. The American people too should be proud of Phil, David, Michele, and Dan representing our country. They have all proven over many years of service that their outstanding diplomatic skills and leadership qualities are much needed and that they are delivering. They’re an inspiration, too. They’re great leaders. I congratulate them all on behalf of the all of my State Department colleagues.


	It’s a good step towards strengthening the State Department’s leadership, something I have put at the top of my priority set in my first now several months here. I know that American diplomacy is most agile and most effective when we have our entire team in place. We need to have that senior leadership team empowered.


	To that end, we do have some new leaders already making an impact. I mentioned David Hale. He’s my Under Secretary for Political Affairs. We also have Director of Policy Planning Kiron Skinner, who I have not mentioned at the podium before. She is highly distinguished academic, knowledgeable across a broad range of issues, and she is going to make sure the best foreign policy ideas rise to the top here at the State Department.


	When I went before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee I only made a couple of promises, but one of them was that I would get the team on the field. I knew that this was critical to strengthening the finest diplomatic corps in the world, and that’s what I said that day. I told them I’d do my part, that I would fill those positions, I would work with the President to get the individuals nominated, and we have made great progress getting confirmable positions filled, and we need that progress to continue.


	The places where we still have gaps, places like Western Hemisphere, where we have challenges in Venezuela and Nicaragua and in Mexico and the Northern Triangle – important areas, we need a leader.


	We haven’t had an under secretary for management here for quite some time. We need a confirmed person.


	And in Near Eastern Affairs, a place that I have spent a great deal of my time in these first months, we are still looking for confirmation of our assistant secretary.


	The list is long. I could go on. And I am just hopeful that we can finish the process so that both the Executive and Legislative Branch will have what it is I know each of us wants: a fully-fielded, capable team executing America’s foreign policy.


	And with that, I am happy to take a few questions.


MS NAUERT: And I’ll call on you, just to help along. Matt Lee from the Associated Press to start. And you have one question each, please.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Hello, Matt.


QUESTION: Sure, hi. Good afternoon, sir. I was going to ask you about your interior decorating plans at your new house, but I thought I would instead start with something a little bit more mundane on the policy-wise. And that is that – on a policy question, that is that last night President Trump tweeted about one of your predecessors, Secretary Kerry, saying that he was having, quote/unquote, “illegal meetings” with Iran’s foreign minister in what others have said is an attempt to undermine or subvert or coach the Iranians on how to get around or avoid the new – your new harder, tougher policy on Iran.


	I’m wondering if you share the President’s view that these meetings are illegal. And whether you do or not, if you have noticed in your attempts to get the Europeans and others, to get them on board with the new U.S. policy, and that efforts by Secretary Kerry, or any other former official for that matter, is interfering in or undermining your efforts.


SECRETARY POMPEO: So I’ll leave the legal determinations to others. But what Secretary Kerry has done is unseemly and unprecedented. This is a former secretary of state engaged with the world’s largest state sponsor of terror, and according to him – right? You don’t have to take my word for it. He – these are his answers. He was talking to them. He was telling them to wait out this administration.


	You can’t find precedent for this in U.S. history, and the secretary ought not – Secretary Kerry ought not to engage in that kind of behavior. It’s inconsistent with what foreign policy of the United States is, as directed by this President, and it is beyond inappropriate for him to be engaged in this. I remember, I saw him. I saw him in Munich at the Security Conference. He was there with – if I have my facts right, because I think I saw them all with my own eyes – Secretary Moniz and Wendy Sherman, the troika. And I am confident that they met with their troika counterparts, although one can perhaps ask Secretary Kerry if my recollection with respect to that is accurate.


	I wasn’t in the meeting, but I am reasonably confident that he was not there in support of U.S. policy with respect to the Islamic Republic of Iran, who this week fired Katyusha rockets toward the United States embassy in Baghdad and took action against our consulate in Basra.


MS NAUERT: Next question.


QUESTION: Well, I just – has it had an impact? Has it hurt your efforts? That’s the – that’s just it, or --


SECRETARY POMPEO: I’ve --


QUESTION: Okay.


SECRETARY POMPEO: I think you understand what I – which it is that former secretaries of state – all of them from either political party – ought not to be engaged in – actively undermining U.S. policy as a former secretary of state is literally unheard of.


MS NAUERT: Lesley Wroughton from Reuters.


QUESTION: Secretary, good afternoon. I wanted to reach out to you regarding Russia and China are suggesting at the Security Council that you should be – the United States and others should be easing sanctions against North Korea given progress in their eyes so far in the denuclearization process. What signs are you seeing that they are perhaps not sticking to the sanctions, and how is that damaging your efforts at trying to get a full denuclearization from North Korea?


SECRETARY POMPEO: So two things to say in this regard. One is that I spoke with Ambassador Haley about this earlier today. Russia has actively attempted to undermine the UN Security Council resolutions, the work of the 1718 Committee, the committee at the UN that evaluates compliance with sanctions, by attempting to change the language there. I hope that the 1718 Committee will do what it has historically done – remain independent and report on the facts as they know it and not allow a single country, in this case Russia, to draft language and have it inserted. I hope they will publish the original document that they intended to publish, which shows – it shows clear activities related to sanctions and sanctions violations. It’s important; it’s the date set that underlays not American sanctions but the world’s sanctions from the UN Security Council.


	Your question was broader than just that. The United States is as committed as ever to continuing to enforce those UN Security Council resolutions. We believe they are central to President Trump’s efforts to convince Chairman Kim that full, final denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula is necessary and that it needs to be done in a way that the world can see that there’s been this strategic change in Chairman Kim’s core understanding of how he will provide a better future for the North Korean people. He said it at the summit in Singapore and we are still continuing to have many conversations with the DPRK about how to effectuate achieving all the commitments that were made during the Singapore summit.


MS NAUERT: Elise, from CNN.


QUESTION: Thank you. Good afternoon, Mr. Secretary.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Yes, ma’am.


QUESTION: On – by September 30th the administration has to give a determination or a decision to Congress about the levels of refugees that will be admitted into the U.S. for the next fiscal year, and there seems to be a debate or a discussion among some who are thinking of it as more of a national security issue and want to keep the levels consistent at a level around 45,000, while there are some that think it should be significantly lower, in the twenty thousands. I’m not sure if you want to give a specific amount, but can you talk to us about your thoughts about how you’re seeing the level of refugees that should be coming in in the near future?


SECRETARY POMPEO: So there will be an announcement soon. You – the date – the deadline is, in fact, this fiscal year and so I’m confident that the national security team will deliver the President’s recommendation. He’ll make his decision about the appropriate level. It is absolutely a national security decision and it is also worth everyone here remembering that this is the most generous of nations when it comes to accepting persons from outside of our country. I am – I’m incredibly proud not only of what we have done as a historical matter, but the way the Trump administration has dealt with this issue as well. I am confident that the decision that comes out of this issue with respect to refugees for next fiscal year, America will remain among the most generous nations with respect to taking persons from outside of our country. We always have and I fully expect that will continue.


MS NAUERT: Last question.


QUESTION: Can you say what your particular thoughts are in terms of numbers?


SECRETARY POMPEO: No, I share those thoughts with the President and then when we have a decision from him we’ll announce it. Thank you.


MS NAUERT: Last question, Rich Edson from Fox News.


QUESTION: Thanks, Heather. Mr. Secretary, do you think that this effort that you were discussing with the JCPOA, do you think it goes beyond those you mentioned, Secretary Kerry and Wendy Sherman? Do you think there are other former administration officials who are advising the Europeans and the Iranians? And will the administration sanction members or the board members or the entity of SWIFT if they continue to process Iranian transactions?


SECRETARY POMPEO: So second question first. I don’t know the decision with respect to SWIFT in particular. There are still a number of decisions pending before the November 1st deadline – excuse me, November 4th deadline that we’ve got to make about waivers or potential waivers, and we’re working our way through each of those. But make no mistake about it, come November 4th there will be a fundamentally different set of rules with respect to anyone who deems it necessary to engage with – in economic activity with the Islamic Republic of Iran.


	It is a big, important day. You can see many countries already taking actions to move out of Iran, to discontinue doing business with them in advance of the November 4th deadline. They understand I think not only the seriousness of the U.S. sanctions but I think they’re also coming to see that this activity is supporting the exact kinds of malign activity that President Trump has been talking about since the first day he took office, whether it’s providing missiles that the Houthis launch into airports in the Gulf states or the activities we’ve seen taken by Shia militias against American interests or the assassination efforts underway in the heart of Europe.


	I think the world is beginning to see that the challenge is much bigger than anything that the JCPOA even pretended to have addressed. And I also see they're thinking comments – they’re seeing statements like the ones that the Iranians have said this week. They’ve said, boy, if we end up withdrawing, we’ll start from a much higher level. I may have the quote off just a little bit but I’m very close. Wow, what does that say about the existence of the agreement, right? They’re going to start from a much higher level. It tells you that the agreement itself didn’t stop all of the paths to nuclear weapons in the way that it was sold to the American people.


	Did I answer? You may have had a first question that I --


QUESTION: And the first question was are there any more administration officials who – previous administration officials who you believe are influencing allies and Iran? And also Secretary Kerry had mentioned that he thinks that the policy of this administration is regime change towards Iran. Is that the policy?


SECRETARY POMPEO: No, it’s not the policy. Ambassador Bolton and I both made very clear that’s not U.S. policy, in repeated sets of remarks. We are very supportive of the Iranian people having the leadership that they want. And as for whether there are other former administration officials engaged in that behavior, I won’t say today. Only to the extent that they are, the admonitions that I suggested for former Secretary Kerry would apply to them as well.


MS NAUERT: Thank you, everybody.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Thank you all.


MS NAUERT: We’ve got to go. Thank you.


SECRETARY POMPEO: You all have a – you all have a great weekend.

The Trump Administration has been clear that ending the conflict in Yemen is a national security priority. We will continue to work closely with the Saudi-led coalition to ensure Saudi Arabia and the UAE maintain support for UN-led efforts to end the civil war in Yemen, allow unimpeded access for the delivery of commercial and humanitarian support through as many avenues as possible, and undertake actions that mitigate the impact of the conflict on civilians and civilian infrastructure.

MINISTER SWARAJ: (Via interpreter) Secretary of State Mr. Pompeo, Secretary of Defense Mr. Mattis, my cabinet colleague Mrs. Nirmala Sitharaman, ladies and gentlemen, and my friends from the media: We have just concluded our talks in the first-ever 2+2 Dialogue between India and the United States. As you know, this new dialogue format was decided by Prime Minister Modi and President Trump during their first meeting in Washington, DC, in June 2017. This decision reflects our leaders’ desire to further elevate our bilateral strategic communication on cross-cutting defense and security issues.


	Friends, this is the first visit abroad by Secretary Pompeo and Secretary Mattis together. This is also Secretary Pompeo’s first visit to India after becoming foreign minister, and this is also my first meeting with him. Naturally, we have had a lot of issues to discuss during this meeting. Prior to the 2+2 Dialogue, I had a bilateral meeting with Secretary Pompeo, and during this meeting we reviewed the direction of our bilateral relations in recent months, and we exchanged views on a number of regional issues of shared concern.


	The recent decision by the United States to put India in the list of countries eligible for Strategic Trade Authorization Tier-1 license exemption reflects India’s robust and responsible export control policies. During our meeting today, we also agreed to work together to secure India’s membership of the Nuclear Suppliers Group at the earliest.


	Friends, an important element of our strategic partnership is our rapidly growing trade and investment ties. Faster growth in these areas and deeper people-to-people connections are a source of strength for our strategic partnership. Rapidly growing economies are giving rise to new opportunities and a basis for more intense economic engagement. This supports development of manufacturing, promotes knowledge and innovation, creates jobs, and also provides critical resources for growth.


	The United States is emerging as a supplier of energy to India as well. We recognized and supported efforts made by the two sides to address trade-related issues on both sides so as to make trade balanced and mutually beneficial.


	With respect to the H1-B visa, we have requested Secretary Pompeo to ensure a nondiscriminatory and predictable approach to the H1-B visa (inaudible), given its high impact on innovation, competitiveness, and people-to-people partnership. All of these are a vital source of strength for our relationship, and I said to Secretary Trump[1] given the friendship between Trump and Prime Minister Mr. Modi, we know that all of our people believe that nothing will ever happen detrimental to our relations between these two countries, and I requested Secretary Pompeo to ensure that we live up to the beliefs of the people of our countries.


	In the context of our four ministers, we have a growing convergence of views between our countries on the Indo-Pacific. Our respective approaches towards this concept have been outlined by our leaders, by President Trump at the APEC meeting last year, and by Prime Minister Modi at the Shangri-La Dialogue this summer. We see the Indo-Pacific region as a free, open, and inclusive concept with ASEAN centrality at the core and defined by a common, rules-based order that both our countries are pursuing.


	We welcome the United States interest in expanding its economic footprint in this region, as this complements our own efforts. We agreed to strengthen our bilateral cooperation as well in order to achieve the common goals related to connectivity and infrastructure, and work together with other partners in this region as well to achieve these goals.


	Friends, in order to fight terrorism we have considerably advanced our cooperation. Last year, the terrorist designations dialogue was established and other mechanisms as well to promote cooperation in counterterrorism. We have agreed to deepen cooperation in international forums like the United Nations and the Financial Action Task Force.


	We welcome the recent designations of Lashkar e-Tayyiba terrorists by the United States. They underscore the international community’s scrutiny over the threat of terrorism emanating from Pakistan, which has affected India and United States alike. On the 10th anniversary of the 26/11 attacks, we recognize the importance of justice and retribution for the masterminds behind this terrorist attack.


	We also discussed the situation in South Asia in some detail. India supports President Trump’s South Asia policy. His call for Pakistan to stop its policy of supporting cross-border terrorism finds resonance with us. We want to also ensure that the call for Pakistan to stop using terrorism as an instrument of state policy.


	We discussed the ongoing efforts by India and the United States in promoting an Afghan-led, Afghan-owned, and Afghan Government-controlled reconciliation process, and this brings together all ethnic groups and political formations in the country. We also had productive exchanges on other regional issues as well.


	Today, overall, I am highly satisfied with our conversation today. The 2+2 meeting has helped shared efforts of both sides to promote a whole-of-government approach for our strategic priorities. India and the United States, as the largest and oldest democracies in the world, each pursuing its independent foreign policies, have many shared global objectives. As equal partners in cooperation our two countries can benefit not only the people of their own countries, but also become a factor for peace and stability in the wider world.


	We have agreed to closely monitor the implementation of the decisions taken today. Secretary Pompeo and I have decided to remain in touch regularly through the new hotline which has been established between our foreign ministers and defense ministers. And we will thus be able to remain continuously in touch, by myself and our defense minister, Mrs. Sitharaman.


MODERATOR: (Inaudible) States, Mr. Michael Pompeo, to give his remarks.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Good afternoon. On behalf of the United States, I would like to thank Minister of External Affairs Swaraj and Minister of Defense Sitharaman for hosting Secretary Mattis and me for this first-ever U.S.-India 2+2 Ministerial Dialogue. It is truly historic and important. Thank you.


	This is my first trip to India as Secretary of State, and it is an honor to travel here for such an important and successful event. Later today, Secretary Mattis and I will meet with Prime Minister Modi. We look forward to discussing how best to advance the U.S.-India relationship, one that is in a new era of growth under his leadership and that of President Trump.


	Today’s 2+2 meeting is symbolic of our increasingly close partnership. We had many productive and forward-thinking conversations on our bilateral relationship, our shared future, and how we can cooperate in promoting a free and open Indo-Pacific.


	As the two largest democracies in the world, the United States and India are deeply bound by our shared values. We have a responsibility to advance a free and open Indo-Pacific that reflects those values: the rule of law; national sovereignty; good governance; the protection of fundamental freedoms, rights, and liberties; free, fair, and reciprocal trade relationships; and peaceful resolutions of territorial and maritime disputes.


	We know our peoples’ ability to exercise their economic and personal freedoms depends on a strong and stable security environment. To that end, today our two countries enter into an ambitious plan to elevate our security cooperation across a number of areas. The Communications Compatibility and Security Agreement is a major step forward in our defense collaboration and coordination. It will allow us to better protect the freedom and prosperity of the Indo-Pacific.


	We also agreed on the scope and scale of military cooperation with India as our major defense partner – a unique status that the United States has granted to India. I’ll let Secretary Mattis speak on this in more detail.


	Today we also discussed a number of pressing regional and global issues, including Afghanistan and North Korea, and how our two countries can work together more closely to address each of those. We also committed to deepen our already strong counterterrorism cooperation.


	On economic matters, President Trump recognizes the long-term strategic importance of India’s economy playing a productive role in the world’s most dynamic and fastest-growing region. He is intent on ensuring the United States, India, and all countries can responsibly reap the benefits of an Indo-Pacific that is open, free with fair trade and investment.


	As just one example of President Trump’s commitment, Secretary of Commerce recently announced Strategic Trade Authorization Tier-1 status for India just a few weeks ago. This will further facilitate high-technology exports from the United States to India. The United States will continue to practice partnership economics with India and all the other countries in the region. We seek to unlock the unparalleled potential of our private sectors to meet the region’s developmental, energy and infrastructure needs, and to create an environment in which businesses and countries can thrive when they play by the rules.


	Today also marks another milestone for our relationship. Thanks to intense advocacy from the United States, 10 years ago today the Nuclear Suppliers Group voted to allow India to engage in trades of civilian nuclear materials and technologies. That vote and the subsequent Section 123 civil nuclear agreement opened a path for our strategic relationship to grow, bolster defense and commercial cooperation and expanded our people-to-people ties. We now look forward to what we can achieve over the next 10 years. In particular, we look forward to finalizing the Westinghouse civil nuclear project that will provide clean and reliable power to millions of Indians.


	I want to close by again thanking our Indian hosts for your generosity that you have shown to me and my colleagues. The United States will continue to work with India to foster greater security and prosperity for our nations, the Indo-Pacific region and indeed the world.


	And with that, I invite the Minister of Defense to make remarks.


MODERATOR: Thank you, sir. It is my now pleasure to request (in Hindi) Nirmala Sitharaman to deliver her remarks to the media.


MINISTER SITHARAMAN: Secretary of State – Defense of the United States, Mr. James Mattis, United States Secretary of State Mr. Michael Pompeo, my respected senior colleague (in Hindi) Sushma Swaraj, friends from the media, and ladies and gentlemen, good afternoon.


	We have just concluded a most productive, positive, and purposeful meeting. I wish to thank Secretaries Mattis and Pompeo for their vision and commitment. We deeply value their support for stronger ties between India and the United States. Our discussions today were marked by the deep friendship that characterizes relations between the greatest democracies of the world. The commitment of India and the United States to defend our shared democratic values and expand on our common interests is clear and unwavering. In today’s meeting, we reaffirmed our intention to cooperate in every possible way to ensure peace and stability as well as to realize the aspirations of our peoples for continued economic growth, prosperity, and development. We will also work together to combat the persisting threat of terrorism and other shared security challenges. In our discussions, we explored the instrumentalities necessary to deliver on those shared objectives.


	Ladies and gentlemen, defense cooperation has emerged as the most significant dimension of our strategic partnership and as a key driver of our bilateral – overall bilateral relationship. The momentum in our defense partnership has imbued a tremendous positive energy that has elevated India-U.S. relations to unprecedented heights. As Prime Minister Narendra Modi had succinctly stated at his address to the U.S. Congress a year ago, India’s relations with the U.S. has overcome the hesitations of history. Nowhere is this more true than in the field of defense.


	Today, India’s defense forces carry out extensive training and joint exercises with the United States. Our joint exercises have acquired greater complexity and newer dimensions both bilaterally and in wider formats. To enhance our synergies in this area, we have decided to carry out for the first time a tri-services joint exercise with the United States off the eastern coast of India in 2019. We are also putting in place an enabling framework for closer cooperation between our defense forces.


	The signing of the Logistics Exchange Memorandum of Agreement, LEMOA, in 2016 and the Helicopter Operations from Ships other Than Aircraft Carriers, the HOSTAC, earlier this year were important steps in this direction.


	The signing of the Communications Compatibility and Security Agreement, COMCASA, today will enable India to access advanced technologies from the U.S. and enhance India’s defense preparedness. Maritime security has been a focus area of our participation and cooperation. To deepen our ties in this area, we will expand our interactions on maritime domain awareness. The United States has renamed its Pacific Command, responsible for relations with India, as Indo-Pacific Command. Reflecting a wider global participation and partnership, we will also enhance our interactions with the United States military’s Central Command.


	Friends, one of the focus areas of the discussions was on expanding the scope and content of the U.S.’s designation of India as its major defense partner. We welcome the recent decision to elevate India to STA Tier-1 status for access to advanced technologies, especially in the defense field. I’m confident that this and other measures to follow will enable our defense industry cooperation to make speedy progress for mutual benefit. We highlighted the major reforms being implemented by the government to promote defense manufacturing in India under the Make in India initiative, including setting up of defense manufacturing corridors.


	We welcome the U.S.’s positive response to India’s request to nominate a point of contact in the U.S. Department of Defense to help address procedural complexities and facilitate Indian companies to join the manufacturing supply chains of the U.S. defense companies. We also identified cooperation in defense innovation as a major area of emphasis for the future. As our defense needs become increasingly driven by technology, this is both necessary and timely. I am particularly thankful to have Secretary Mattis, who has spent several years in Silicon Valley, as our interlocutor in taking this aspect of our ties forward. The memorandum of intent between our defense innovation agencies, which has been signed virtually last night, is a first step in this direction.


	Ladies and gentlemen, the conclusion of the first-ever Ministerial 2+2 between India and the United States is a concrete manifestation of the vision of our leaders, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and President Donald Trump, to take the India-U.S. relationship to a new level. Our leaders recognize that it is no longer viable to address foreign and defense issues in a compartmentalized manner. In today’s meeting, we were able to discuss a range of issues relating to our ties in a strategic framework and identify steps to take forward our relationship. Our discussions have paved the way for a new era in India-U.S. defense and strategic engagement. Given our shared interests, we are confident that we can work together to promote peace, economic prosperity and security in our region and beyond. I once again thank Secretary Pompeo and Secretary Mattis for their engagement in promoting the India-U.S. partnership. Thank you.


MODERATOR: Thank you, ma’am. And finally, may I call upon the Secretary of Defense of the United States, Mr. James Mattis, to deliver his statement to the media.


SECRETARY MATTIS: Well, good afternoon ladies and gentlemen, and Minister Swaraj and Minister Sitharaman, just thank you for the warm hospitality and the professional discussions that we have had here today. It’s a pleasure to be back in New Delhi among friends and representing the United States alongside Secretary of State Pompeo. And Minister Sitharaman, I would just say that I wholeheartedly concur with how you characterized the defense relationship in your statement just now. Today’s fruitful discussion illustrated the value of continued collaboration between these two coequal democracies. It’s a strong relationship between the world’s two largest democracies and it did not begin with those of us sitting here before you. We inherited it, and now we ensure it is even stronger when we pass it to our successors on a higher trajectory than we received it.


	Since India gained its independence in 1947, our nations have shared a fundamental respect and love of freedom. Just three years after India’s independence, Prime Minister Nehru visited the United States – in his words, and I quote – “On a voyage of discovery of the mind and heart of America.” Today, Secretary Pompeo and I bring the same spirit that Prime Minister Nehru carried to Washington almost 70 years ago, promoting the cooperation which both our countries earnestly desire. Today’s successful and highly productive meeting, the first ever 2+2 between our nations at the ministerial level, has further bolstered our strong defense relationship, as you just heard. We reiterated our highest respect for each other’s sovereignty and committed to work together for a safe, secure, prosperous and free Indo-Pacific, one that is underpinned by the rule of law.


	We appreciate India’s role as a stabilizing force on the region’s geographic front lines. Your nation understands better than many peace and prosperity are only attainable when all respect the principles of territorial integrity, freedom of navigation, freedom from coercion. All of these are fundamental to the rules-based order. Only then, to borrow Prime Minister Modi’s words, can nations small and large prosper free and fearless in their choices. We will continue working together to enhance and expand India’s role as a primary major defense partner, to elevate our relationship to a level commensurate with our closest allies and partners. Today we took, as you know, a significant step towards that goal by signing the Communications Compatibility and Security Agreement. The landmark agreement deepens our military-to-military cooperation and our ability to share the most advanced defense technology, making us both stronger.


	In addition, we agreed to increase and expand our engagement in the maritime domain with a new tri-service exercise. And Secretary Pompeo and I also gained insights on a range of issues from the DPRK sanction enforcement to counterterrorism cooperation, recognizing that both our nations have endured the effects of senseless terrorist attacks like those 10 years ago in Mumbai, which killed innocents from more than a dozen nations. We remember those lives lost as we approach the 10th anniversary of attacks this November. Today, the steps we took will pave the way ahead for an even closer military relationship. Our meeting signified the bright future ahead for our two nations, indicating the growing trust we share as strategic partners. We look forward to meeting with Prime Minister Modi this afternoon, and welcome the opportunity to thank him for his strong leadership and to discuss the way ahead, and thank you very much.


MODERATOR: Thank you, sir. This concludes the press statement ceremony and thank you all for joining.

MINISTER SWARAJ: Secretary of State Mr. Michael Pompeo, Secretary of Defense Mr. James Mattis, my esteemed colleague Nirmala Sitharaman, Excellencies: I extend a very warm welcome to you to India. We are delighted to have both of you here for the very first meeting of Indo-U.S. 2+2 Dialogue.


	Secretary Pompeo and I met briefly yesterday upon his arrival in New Delhi on his first official visit here. Secretary Mattis has been here earlier, and it is my pleasure to welcome you to my ministry. Both of you are strong supporters of the India-U.S. relationship, and it is only right that we are meeting in New Delhi with the both of you.


	The 2+2 mechanism has been created in accordance with a decision taken by Prime Minister Modi and President Trump in Washington, D.C., in June last year. It reflects the growing maturity of our strategic partnership. It will facilitate even greater synergies in our engagement in defense and economically (inaudible).


	India attaches the highest priority to its strategic partnership with the United States. It is a partnership based on shared democratic values, growing convergence of interests, and robust people-to-people linkages. We see the United States as the partner of choice in our efforts to achieve rapid social economic transformation of India. We believe that the U.S. continued economic prosperity and leadership in world affairs is in India’s interest.


	Similarly, India’s great political, economic, and security role can reinforce U.S. efforts to promote stability in the region. Partnership between India and the U.S. will not only benefit our two peoples but is also necessary to effectively tackle regional and global challenges. As Prime Minister Modi described at this year’s Shangri-La Dialogue, it is, I quote, “a global strategic partnership [which] continues to deepen across the extraordinary breadth of our relationship.”


	During their meeting last year in June, Prime Minister Modi and President Trump set the future direction for our relationship. I am happy to note that there has been significant progress in all of the areas of our engagement, however the potential for what we can do together is a lot more. I am confident that our discussions today and the decisions that we will take will help us unleash the untapped potential of our relations and further elevate the level of our partnership.


	I would now recognize His Excellency, Secretary of State Mr. Pompeo, to make his opening remarks. This will be followed by opening remarks by my colleague, Defense Minister Sitharaman (inaudible), and then by Secretary of Defense Mr. Mattis.


	Secretary Pompeo.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Minister, thank you. Thank you for hosting us both. Thank you for hosting this important engagement. I am delighted to be making my first trip to India as the Secretary of State now 16 weeks into my time, and especially because I’m here for this important first 2+2 Strategic Dialogue between our two countries. It is a clear demonstration the United States places in terms of priority on the relationship between the United States and India.


	Our partnership has been steadily growing since Prime Minister Modi visited the White House last June. President Trump is eager for it to continue, and he told Secretary Mattis and I that before we departed. We fully support India’s rise as a leading global power, and we welcome India’s equal commitment to our partnership.


	Our two nations are united by shared values of democracy, respect for individual rights, and a shared commitment to freedom. Given those values, India and the United States have a natural starting point for advancing a free and open Indo-Pacific. We should continue to ensure the freedom of the seas and the skies; uphold the peaceful resolution of territorial maritime disputes; promote market-based economics; support good governance, fundamental rights, and liberties; and prevent external economic coercion.


	We know the threats to stability that exist in the region, and the United States seeks to ensure that both of our peoples can live in peace and in freedom. For years now, our counterterrorism cooperation has deepened, with progress on terrorist designations and information sharing, and is solidified through regular bilateral counterterrorism joint working group meetings. I hope we can continue to make progress on counterterrorism today.


	We also hope to discuss how India can further work with the United States to achieve the final, fully verifiable, denuclearization of North Korea, and we should explore ways to partner on holding this outlaw regime in Iran responsible for all of its malign activity.


	Together our nations can achieve our shared vision of prosperity and security as we build a relationship that will help shape the 21st century.


	Thank you, Madam Minister.


MINISTER SWARAJ: Thank you, Secretary Pompeo. Now I invite my colleague, (inaudible).


MINISTER SITHARAMAN: Thank you, Madam. Secretary James Mattis, Secretary Michael Pompeo. It is indeed a great pleasure to welcome both of you, Secretary Mattis and Secretary Pompeo, in Delhi this morning. I extend a warm welcome on behalf of the Ministry of Defense of India.


	Today’s meeting marks a defining moment in our bilateral ties. The commencement of the first-ever ministerial 2+2 between India and the United States is a concrete manifestation of the bold vision of our leaders, Prime Minister Modi and President Donald Trump, to take the India-U.S. relationship to an even higher trajectory.


	This meeting is also a reflection of the tremendous focus that we have made in developing our ties over the past few years. At the same time, it is a strong recognition of the immense potential of our bilateral partnership for the benefit of our peoples, the region, and beyond.


	As Secretary Mattis and I agreed during our brief interaction this morning, defense cooperation has established itself as one of the most significant dimensions of our relationship. It is now a key driver of our strategic partnership. India-U.S. cooperation in the field of defense reflects the growing maturity of our partnership, which is also a testament to our shared democratic values and common interests of both of our great nations.


	As we continue to make progress in our defense and security ties, with each step that brings our defense forces and our security entities closer to each other, we add to the growing layers of mutual trust and confidence. Today, India’s defense forces carry out more training and joint exercises with the United States than with any other foreign partner. We have acquired various advanced weapons platforms from the U.S. We are thus partners in building defense capability in the broadest sense of the term.


	Together we are also putting in place an enabling form a framework of closer cooperation between our militaries and our defense establishments. With the announcement of the U.S. designation of India as a major defense partner of the United States and the recent decision to elevate India to STA Tier-1 status for access to advanced U.S. dual-use items, we are hopeful that our defense industry cooperation can also move forward faster in tandem with other dimensions of the defense partnership.


	We are transitioning from a buyer-seller relationship to one that is more balanced, mutually beneficial, and sustainable. The Government of India has introduced major reforms to promote defense manufacturing in India, including the establishment of defense manufacturing corridor. I invite U.S. companies to become our active partners in this effort. We have identified cooperation in defense innovation as a major area of emphasis for the future. The Memorandum of Intent between our defense innovation agencies is the first significant step that we are making in this direction.


	I look forward to our discussions today, and now would (inaudible) Secretary Mattis.


MINISTER SWARAJ: Thank you. Nirmala. Now I invite Secretary Mattis to deliver his opening remarks.


SECRETARY MATTIS: Well, Minister Swaraj and Minister Sitharaman, thank you for hosting this inaugural 2+2, and I echo your words: We embrace on the American side this opportunity, and we share in your confidence in strengthening this top-priority relationship.


	At this point, I do want to express our condolences for the lives lost here in the Kerala floods, but I must also applaud the Indian military’s role in saving so many lives in the midst of that tragedy. Even today as we sit here, our thoughts are with those who lost loved ones.


	In our two nations, as reservoirs of religious, cultural, and ethnic diversity, and as proud maritime peoples, we see the U.S.-India relationship as a natural partnership between the world’s two largest democracies, a partnership that is based on convergence of enduring strategic interests and shared respect for the rules-based order.


	Our discussion today is a testament to the power of free peoples. I note that over seven decades ago this week, the United States established diplomatic relations with India, prior to its formal independence. Today, our partnership has become one of the most consequential in the region and in the world.


	As Prime Minister Modi said at Shangri-La last June, “A commitment to common values must be shared…the foundation upon which we build a shared destiny.” The U.S. and India already have that foundation in our commitment to a safe, secure, prosperous, and free Indo-Pacific region, where sovereignty of all nations is respected, international norms are upheld, disputes are resolved peacefully, and nations freely transit international waters and airspace, and further to borrow Prime Minister Modi’s words again, nations are free from impossible debt burdens imposed by others.


	We welcome your insights on how to uphold our shared commitment to the rule of law in the Indo-Pacific, and certainly counterterrorism looms large. We note that 2018 marks 10 years since the Mumbai attacks, where innocent citizens from both of our nations as well as 10 other nations perished at the hands of international terrorism, and we do not forget.


	India’s leadership in the world supports our shared democratic values regionally and globally. We also recognize the increasing connectivity between the Indian and Pacific Oceans, renaming U.S. Pacific Command to the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command. With India as a major defense partner, we are elevating our defense relationship to be on a par with our closest allies as we deepen the broader U.S.-India relationship, enhancing our interoperability, our defense trade, our technology innovation and industrial collaboration, and bolstering our people-to-people bonds.


	I appreciate the transparency in our interactions because it reflects the trust we must share for both our nations to benefit from this relationship, and you will not find our military operating outside the framework of our diplomatic – set by our diplomats.


	To conclude, fellow ministers, thank you again for your initiatives in seizing this unique moment with us, and I look forward to hearing your vision for our strategic partnership, and we are ready to work alongside you to take it upon a higher trajectory. Thank you.


MINISTER SWARAJ: Thank you, Secretary Mattis.

SECRETARY POMPEO: (In progress) just a few moments to wrap up this trip to India and Pakistan, my first visit to both countries as Secretary of State, and we’ll be meeting with Prime Minister Modi here in just a little bit and are very much looking forward to that. His leadership along with that of President Trump have truly put the relationship between India and the United States on a good plane with an upward trajectory.


	My meetings were all productive with each of the counterparts, and here in India I must say the kickoff of the 2+2 was pretty special, a historic level of relationship that the two countries have not previously had. And I think each of us valued the opportunity to have good, strong, candid discussions. We’ve had 70 years of diplomatic relationships with India, and it was important for the four of us to work together through this dialogue so that we can continue to keep these two relationships both intertwined and moving towards our set of shared objectives of the world’s two largest democracies.


	We’re happy that we were able to announce two agreement with India, the COMCASA agreement, and we also agreed to enhance our military cooperation with India as our major defense partner.


	In Pakistan yesterday, we agreed that it’s time to start delivering on our joint commitments. There was broad agreement between myself, Foreign Minister Qureshi, and Prime Minister Khan that we need to take steps that will deliver outcomes on the ground, allowing us to begin to build confidence and trust between our two countries.


	I’ve also had fun. On both stops I’ve had the chance to meet with teams from our embassy – always the highlight of my trip to meet with our diplomats and our locally employed staff to deliver President Trump’s foreign policy priorities.


	And with that, I’m happy to take a couple questions.


MS NAUERT: (Inaudible), go ahead.


QUESTION: If I could start with North Korea, sir, there are new reports today that Kim Jong-un is saying a declaration ending the Korean War would not lead to withdrawal of U.S. troops in South Korea. Do you see this as a concession, and does denuclearization need to come before an end-of-war declaration? And finally, are there any plans to meet with the North Koreans at the UNGA?


SECRETARY POMPEO: So as I’ve said consistently as we’ve been continuing to work with the North Koreans to deliver on the world’s demands, the UN Security Council resolutions, which demand a number of things from North Korea and from no one else. There’s only country that has a commitment under those Security Council resolutions.


	As I’ve said before, I’m not going to talk about ongoing negotiations, discussions that we’re having, with the North Koreans. We will work – we will continue to work with them to deliver for the world, as against the UN Security Council resolutions, and for Chairman Kim to deliver on the commitment that he made to President Trump in Singapore now back on June 12th.


MS NAUERT: The next question, Nick Wadhams from Bloomberg.


QUESTION: Mr. Secretary, I’m sure you’ve heard the story that’s gripping Washington right now is this anonymous op-ed in The New York Times. Were you the author of that op-ed? Could you comment on it? Thank you.


SECRETARY POMPEO: So it shouldn’t surprise anyone that The New York Times, a liberal newspaper that has attacked this administration relentlessly, chose to print such a piece. And if that piece is true, if it’s accurate, if it’s actually – I think they described it as a senior administration official – they should not well have chosen to take a disgruntled, deceptive, bad actor’s word for anything and put it in their newspaper.


	It’s sad more than anything else that our nation has come to where you have – again, if it is what it’s purported to be, it is sad that you have someone who would make that choice. I come from a place where, if you’re not in a position to execute the commander’s intent, you have a singular option: It is to leave. And this person – and said, according to The New York Times – chose not only to stay but to undermine what President Trump and this administration are trying to do. And I ought to tell you, just I find – I find the media’s efforts in this regard to undermine this administration incredibly disturbing.


MS NAUERT: The next question --


SECRETARY POMPEO: And I’ll answer your other question directly, because I know someone will say, gosh, he didn’t answer the question. It’s not mine.


QUESTION: Mr. Secretary, I have a question about India and also about North Korea.


	On North Korea, (inaudible) that Chairman Kim (inaudible) timeline for the first time in terms of when he would denuclearize. But at the same time, the U.S. intelligence assessment (inaudible) concluded that, actually, they were still working on a program (inaudible). And could you help us understand (inaudible) what next steps in light of the developments (inaudible)?


	On India, was there a request to the Indians that they buy more U.S. oil and less Iranian oil?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Let me take the second one first. We have told the Indians consistently, as we have told every nation, that on November 4th the sanctions with respect to Iranian crude oil will be enforced, and that we will consider waivers where appropriate, but that it is our expectation that the purchases of Iranian crude oil will go to zero from every country, or sanctions will be imposed. So we’ll work with the Indians. We committed that we would do that. Many countries are in a place where they – it takes a little bit of time to unwind, and we’ll work with them, I am sure, to find an outcome that makes sense.


	And from whence they purchase the other crude oil, we’re happy to see if it’s American products that are able to deliver for them. I think that’d be a great outcome. But our mission set is to make sure that Iran doesn’t engage in malign behavior with wealth that comes from countries around the world, thus the purpose of the sanctions.


	On North Korea, no, I’m not going to talk about the negotiations and what the next steps might be. It is the case that there is still an enormous amount of work to do. We haven’t had any nuclear tests, we haven’t had any missile tests, which we consider a good thing. But the work of convincing Chairman Kim to make the strategic shift that we’ve talked about for a brighter future for the people of North Korea continues.


MS NAUERT: Last question, and it’s from Joanna Slater from Washington Post.


QUESTION: Hi, Secretary Pompeo.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Hi.


QUESTION: Can I ask you about two other areas of friction with India? Sorry, it’s one question but --.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Be clever. Make it (a) and (b) and we’ll – it’ll all work.


QUESTION: The first – the first is the S-400. Is the President inclined to grant a waiver for that purchase? And the second is on trade. Has the U.S., in fact, made demands of India for certain purchase – purchases of – (inaudible) its purchases of U.S. goods over three years? And your personal relationship with Foreign Minster Swaraj – I’d like (inaudible).


SECRETARY POMPEO: So I haven’t known her for a long time. I met her in person for the first time today, but we’ve spoken by phone previously. We have a good discussion, one that is marked by true candor. I think we both share our concerns in places where we think our two countries can work together to do better and create opportunity as well.


	With respect to the S-400, no decision has been made. We are working to impose CAATSA Section 231 in a way that is appropriate and lawful and to exercise that waiver authority only where it makes sense. And we as a team, the national security team, will work on that, and as we continue to have these conversations with India about that, I think come to an outcome that makes sense for each of our two countries.


	You had a third one.


QUESTION: Trade.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Trade, yeah. Trade, very straightforward: free, fair, and reciprocal. We want the trade balance, the trade deficit that the United States has in its trade with India, to be rectified. They have made some progress on that, and we thank them for that. They’re going to buy more energy products from the United States. They’re going to purchase more aircraft from the United States. We truly do appreciate that. But the gap will remain, and so we are urging them to do all that they can to narrow that gap.


	At the same time, it’s important that the trade barriers that are there, places that American companies’ and American workers’ products can’t be sold here, be reduced. And so very consistent what President Trump is seeking all around the world are the things we talked about with our Indian counterparts here today.


MS NAUERT: Thank you, everybody.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Great. Thanks, everybody. Go ahead, I’ll take one more. You look very forlorn. (Laughter.)


QUESTION: I just want to clarify on the S-400, is the idea that you’re – the Indians are so far down in the (inaudible) S-400 that it’s not reasonable really to sanction them (inaudible)?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Yeah, I wouldn’t say that. I wouldn’t. There’s been no decision made. But I will share that we do understand the history, right, of India’s relationship with Russia and legacy systems. Our effort here, too, is not to penalize great strategic partners like India, a major defense partner. The sanctions aren’t intended to adversely impact countries like India. They are intended to be a – have an impact on the sanctioned country, which is Russia.


	And so we’ll work our way through the waiver decision as the days and weeks proceed, and we’ll do that alongside our partner, India, as well.


MS NAUERT: Thank you, everybody.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Great. Thanks, everybody.

",Remarks to the Press,http://www.state.gov/secretary/remarks/2018/09/285732.htm
"September 5, 2018","
SECRETARY POMPEO: (In progress) well as General Bajwa in a number of settings. We talked about their new government, the opportunity to reset the relationship between our two countries across a broad spectrum – economic, business, and commercial, the work that we all know that we need to do to try and develop a peaceful resolution in Afghanistan, which benefits certainly Afghanistan but also the United States and Pakistan. And I’m hopeful that the foundation that we laid today will set the conditions for continued success as we start to move forward.


GENERAL DUNFORD: And my job was to help support the Secretary as he – as he sought to reset the relationship. When we talked to General Bajwa on the military-to-military level, we agreed that – we listened to the prime minister very carefully, we listened to the Secretary very carefully. Their objectives were very consistent between the Secretary and the prime minister, and General Bajwa and I agreed that we will leverage the military-to-military relationship to support the Secretary and the prime minister, and more importantly, President Trump’s South Asia strategy.


MS NAUERT: Take a couple of questions.


QUESTION: Did you get any firm commitments from the Pakistanis that would potentially merit the resumption of military security assistance? Do you think they are a reliable partner going forward?


SECRETARY POMPEO: So we’ve still got a long way to go, lots more discussion to be had, but the relationship military to military is one that has remained in a place where some of the other relationships haven’t, frankly. They’ve still continued to have relationships, worked on lots of projects that are important together, and I hope we can use that as one of the foundational elements as well.


QUESTION: Will the GLOCs continue to stay open? Did the Pakistanis raise the issue of GLOC access?


GENERAL DUNFORD: We don’t – we don’t have any reason to indicate that our cooperation in keeping the GLOCs open is going to change. That’s --


MS NAUERT: Let’s do a last question.


QUESTION: Was there any kind of U.S. warning of increased punitive action that financially sanctions against certain Pakistani individuals delivered during these talks that – if they don’t change their behavior, there’s next steps?


SECRETARY POMPEO: We made clear to them that – and they agreed – it’s time for us to begin to deliver on our joint commitments, right. So we’ve had lots of times where we’ve talked and made agreements, but we haven’t been able to actually execute those. And so there was broad agreement between myself and Foreign Minister Qureshi, as well as with the prime minister, that we need to begin to do things that will begin to actually, on the ground, deliver outcomes so that we can begin to build confidence and trust between the two countries. That was the focus of the gathering.


MS NAUERT: All right. Thanks, everybody. Thank you.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Thanks.


QUESTION: Thanks for doing this.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Thanks, everybody.

",Remarks With Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Joseph Dunford,http://www.state.gov/secretary/remarks/2018/09/285710.htm
"September 4, 2018","
SECRETARY POMPEO: So just a couple things. So first stop Pakistan, a new leader there. I wanted to get out there at the beginning of his time in an effort to reset the relationship between the two countries. We have worked closely with the Pakistanis in my role as CIA director. Our teams have been working together for a long time. There are lots of challenges between our two nations for sure, but we’re hopeful that with new leadership that we can find common ground and begin to work on some of our shared problems together. They have expressed good-faith intention to do so.


	Chairman Dunford and I are heading out there together to have those conversations. We’ll also meet with General Bajwa, who we both know, who I’ve met with a number of times, as well as my counterpart, Foreign Minister Qureshi. So we’ll have three opportunities to walk through the complexity that is this relationship and hopefully begin to make some progress so that we can get back to a set of common understandings. So that’s really the very straightforward objective. I think it’s important to meet the new prime minister, Prime Minister Khan, early on in his time in office.


	And then on to India, where we have now twice had to postpone this incredibly important meeting. I regret it was my fault the second time. I had to travel to Pyongyang. But Secretary Mattis and I are both looking forward to this. We have a true strategic partner who, frankly, is our only major defense partner, right, the only designated major defense partner, with whom we have a great relationship and who is very important to our success in our Indo-Pacific strategy – enormous country with incredibly opportunity and capacity for wealth creation. We hope we can find opportunities to continue to expand the relationship not only diplomatic and military-to-military but a good set of business relationships as well.


QUESTION: (Off-mike.)


SECRETARY POMPEO: That’ll be good. I’ve met all these folks before, but I’m very much looking forward to my time with them on this trip. And it’s important that we get both my counterpart and Secretary Mattis’ counterpart, the four of us working together, because these relationships are so closely intertwined because of the nature of the U.S.-Indian relationship.


QUESTION: (Off-mike.)


SECRETARY POMPEO: That’ll be good.


QUESTION: So if we could start with Pakistan.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Yeah.


QUESTION: Obviously, the trip comes right after the announcement that 300 million in military aid is being cut. What do you think of that as a start-off point for this new relationship that you’re trying to build? It seems maybe they (inaudible) contrary to (inaudible).


	And then also, in lieu of that, do you worry that moves like that could push Pakistan closer to China when they’re in an economic tailspin, if you will, considering IMF returning to China?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Yeah. Look, this wasn’t news to the Pakistanis. It made a lot of headlines over the last few days because of the formality (inaudible), but they were told this past summer that they weren’t likely to get that money. And the rationale for them not getting the money is very clear. It’s that we haven’t seen the progress that we need to see from them. And the very reason for this trip is to try and articulate what it is our expectation is, the things that they can do, the things that they expect us to do, and see if we can’t find a path forward together.


	So look, I think there’s a new government. This – most of this took place long before the prime minister was in power, and I’m hoping we can turn the page and begin to make progress. But there are real expectations. We need Pakistan to seriously engage to help us get to the reconciliation we need in Afghanistan. Without their assistance, without their help, you’ve heard General Nicholson and General Miller both – the incoming and outgoing commanders – they’ve both talked about this. They are – they have important interests, security interests in Afghanistan to make sure they get the issues at their border right, and we need their help.


	And so I’m hopeful we can convince them to provide that assistance because they will acknowledge – and indeed in my conversation with the prime minister – acknowledge peace in Afghanistan is – I think he said they’re the number one or number two advocate for reconciliation in Afghanistan. I said I think we’re number three – all of us wanting that. So we have a shared goal there. I hope we can find a way to achieve it together.


QUESTION: Would that aid be back on the table if you do see measures that meet your --


SECRETARY POMPEO: It’s – I think the answer – I think the answer is probably yes, right? If we get to the place – you have to remember what it was. Some of this was – we use the term “aid” loosely there. It’s more complicated; it’s different sets of resources. But we were providing these resources when they made sense for the United States, when it made sense because the partnership was in a place that the actions of our two countries, it made sense to do that. If that arises again, I am confident we’ll present to the President the rationale for that, and then something like that might make sense.


QUESTION: Was there a sense then that the previous decision made by the State Department to withhold aid, whenever – when was that, about a year ago – that that year has not – was essentially lost time, that they’ve made none of the progress you expected to see from them? Or is this more like delivering the same message to a new set of actors who are now in control?


SECRETARY POMPEO: We certainly haven’t seen the progress that we would hope to have seen, certainly not progress that would be sufficient for us to have advocated for turning back on those – that financial support.


QUESTION: Okay. And we noticed that Ambassador Khalilzad is on the plane. Is he --


SECRETARY POMPEO: Yes, I have two new folks traveling with us, a new P who’s coming back to the place he served as ambassador just a handful of days ago and Ambassador Khalilzad. Ambassador Khalilzad’s going to join the State Department team to assist us on the reconciliation effort, so he will come on and be the State Department’s lead person for that purpose.


QUESTION: So (inaudible) as like SRAP or the special --


SECRETARY POMPEO: I don’t even know what – yes. So I don’t know – I – actually, I want to say no --


QUESTION: Okay.


SECRETARY POMPEO: -- because I don’t want to – I know that has some history especially. But his task is going to be working with Ambassador Wells and Ambassador Bass and our team to be full-time focused on developing the opportunities to get the Afghans and Taliban to come to a reconciliation. That will be his singular mission statement.


QUESTION: Okay. And then --


SECRETARY POMPEO: I should say it is starting today, so --


QUESTION: Yeah. Okay. On India, how much of a --


QUESTION: Can I just ask one more thing --


QUESTION: Yeah, go ahead.


QUESTION: -- before we get to India? On Pakistan, have you or do you expect to raise the case of Dr. Afridi on this trip?


SECRETARY POMPEO: I have a long history of raising the case of Dr. Afridi as the CIA director. I’ll leave it at that.


QUESTION: Do you – do you see the – on the issue of the Indians buying a missile defense system from Russia and then also their reluctance or so far professed reluctance to down to zero on Iran as distractions for this trip or sort of fundamental issues that you plan to discuss?


SECRETARY POMPEO: They’re part of the conversation. They’re part of the relationship. They will certainly come up, but I don’t think they’ll be the primary focus of what it is we’re trying to accomplish here. There’s half a dozen things on the agenda that we’re really intent on making progress on. Those decisions are important, they’re important to the relationship for sure, but I don’t see us resolving those or having even – have intention to resolve those during this set of meetings of the Strategic Dialogue. They’re really about things that are big and strategic and will go on for 20, 40, 50 years. Those are the kinds of topics that Secretary Mattis and I are hoping to address – not that those aren’t important, but they’re not part of the structural relationship between the two countries.


MS NAUERT: We have two minutes left, guys.


QUESTION: Can I ask about Idlib? I mean, the President’s --


SECRETARY POMPEO: Yeah, sure.


QUESTION: The President’s tweet yesterday was pretty clear in what he expects that Russia not to do or the Assad government not to do. Have you had conversations with the Turks or with others about making sure that this does not proceed? And if it does, what is the U.S. response going to be?


SECRETARY POMPEO: So I’ve had conversations with lots of the potential participants. I’ve spoken with Foreign Minister Lavrov about this. I spoke with my Turkish counterpart, Cavusoglu, this morning about it. We have a shared goal there. The Turks have outposts in Idlib, continuing. We are hoping that this can be resolved diplomatically.


	I’ve seen the reports of the Russian bombing and the Syrian bombing that’s taking place today, or took place – would have been last night their time. The Russians made a commitment that said this was a deescalation zone and this would be resolved through the Geneva process. I think the President’s tweet was an effort to remind them of the commitment that they made.


MS NAUERT: (Inaudible.) We’ve got to go.


QUESTION: I mean, they do not seem particularly intent on fulfilling that commitment.


SECRETARY POMPEO: The humanitarian crisis that could be here is different in kind, right? Many of the people who fled these other deescalation zones fled to this location. There’s no place for these people to go, and the Russians have the narrative that there are terrorists in Idlib. That is a true statement. We share their concern about terrorism emanating from northern, northwest Syria. We absolutely agree with them there are terrorists in those locations and they need to be taken care of such that they don’t export terror around the world.


	It is not the way to do that to put the lives of all these innocent civilians at risk and create a humanitarian crisis, and I think that’s what you saw the President saying last night was we’re happy to work on the terrorism issue in this place, you made an agreement to handle this in a way that is different from what it appears you’re thinking, please take that seriously.


	Then of course, too, we’re always concerned they may use chemical weapons in the process of trying to obtain their military objective, and I think – I think the President could not have been more clear over the last year in both word and action about how he feels about the use of chemical weapons.


MS NAUERT: Okay, we’ve got to go, guys.


QUESTION: Is military action on the table?


MS NAUERT: We’ve got to --


QUESTION: Is military action --


MS NAUERT: All right.


SECRETARY POMPEO: I --


MS NAUERT: He’s the Secretary of State. (Laughter.)


SECRETARY POMPEO: (Off-mike.)


QUESTION: So can we – this is on the record.


SECRETARY POMPEO: That’s for – it’s for --


MS NAUERT: Yes.


SECRETARY POMPEO: We’re going to leave it with what the President’s statement was for the time being.


	(Break.)


SECRETARY POMPEO: (In progress) -- progress the State Department has made to put a qualified candidates before the White House, getting the nominations through the White House, and our efforts to get them in their seats. We really need some of these leaders to execute our mission, and so I want to make sure that we’re clear about what it is that we’ve done and what we’re doing and the quality of the people, both career Foreign Service officers and otherwise, that we’re putting in front of the Senate.


QUESTION: Is it your impression that the Senate – I mean, I think that during the Brian Bulatao hearing Jeff Flake had basically said I’m going to hold these confirmations until I get this answer on Cuba. Sorry. Is it your understanding that that hold has been lifted and that these – because obviously (inaudible) --


SECRETARY POMPEO: It is. Some of this is just – look, some of this is Senate queue, and I accept that. I understand they have their set of priorities. But from where I sit, it is really important. These are some – the DG/HR, the head of WHA, the head of Pol-Mil, the M – these are people who run big organizations at the State Department, and we need leaders in place to help execute the mission that the Senate has asked me to go execute. And so I’m very hopeful that we can here in the month of September get those folks through and working on the mission that I know I share with a bipartisan consensus in the Senate, right? They want an efficiently run State Department. They want someone in that M slot. They want Political-Military to be run well. We just need those people to get them across the line.


QUESTION: Okay.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Okay. Thank you.

	Today, oral proceedings before the International Court of Justice (ICJ) began in The Hague on an application for provisional measures in a case brought by Iran against the United States, Alleged Violations of the 1955 Treaty of Amity, Economic Relations, and Consular Rights. Iran’s filing with the ICJ is an attempt to interfere with the sovereign rights of the United States to take lawful actions, including re-imposition of sanctions, which are necessary to protect our national security. The proceedings instituted by Iran are a misuse of the Court.


	Iran brought the case last month to challenge the U.S. decision to cease participation in the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) and to reimpose the sanctions that were suspended as part of that deal.


	President Trump withdrew from the JCPOA for a simple reason: it failed to guarantee the safety of the American people from the risk created by Iran’s leaders.


	We will vigorously defend against Iran’s meritless claims this week in The Hague, and we will continue to work with our allies to counter the Iranian regime’s destabilizing activities in the region, block their financing of terror, and address Iran’s proliferation of ballistic missiles and other advanced weapons systems that threaten international peace and stability. We will also ensure Iran has no path to a nuclear weapon – not now, not ever.

SECRETARY POMPEO: Good morning, everyone. I’m excited to announce this morning that Steve Biegun is joining our team as the special representative for North Korea.


	Steve will direct U.S. policy towards North Korea and lead our efforts to achieve President Trump’s goal of the final, fully verified denuclearization of North Korea, as agreed to by Chairman Kim Jong-un.


	It’s a very timely moment for Steve to join the team and come on board. He and I will be traveling to North Korea next week to make further diplomatic progress towards our objective.


	Steve is taking the reins of a great team effort. The State Department has already done excellent work in implementing and sustaining the pressure campaign, putting together the first-ever leader-level summit in Singapore, and laying the groundwork to hold North Korea accountable to the promises that Chairman Kim has made. As the special representative, Steve will lead negotiations and spearhead diplomatic efforts with our allies and partners.


	Steve has had extensive career in foreign policy and in tough negotiating settings as well. He comes to us from his position as the vice president of international government affairs for the Ford Motor Company. In this job, he closely engaged foreign governments to advance Ford’s goals all around the world. He will now employ the same skill and dedication on behalf of the American people to make sure that their interests are well served in respect to North Korea.


	Steve also spent nearly two decades doing foreign policy work on Capitol Hill and in the executive branch. His positions have included national security advisor to former Senate Majority Leader Senator Bill Frist. He was the executive secretary at the National Security Council under President George W. Bush and the chief of staff at the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.


	Using diplomacy to resolve the North Korean security threat once and for all remains one of President Trump’s greatest priorities, and Steve is eminently qualified for the task and clear-eyed in the challenge before us. I’m fully confident that he will be able to lead our mission in ensuring a secure future for the American people and – we hope – a far brighter future for the people of North Korea.


	And now I’d like to invite our new special representative for North Korea, Steve Biegun, to say a few words.


MR BIEGUN: Thank you very much, Mr. Secretary. And I want to start by thanking you and the President for having given me an incredible opportunity to once again serve our great nation.


	I fully understand the importance of this job – the President, you, and the American people – and what you expect from all of us in achieving a more peaceful world. The issues are tough, and they will be tough to resolve. But the President has created an opening, and its one that we must take by seizing every possible opportunity to realize the vision for a peaceful future for the people of North Korea.


	This begins with the final, fully verified denuclearization of North Korea as agreed by Chairman Kim Jong-un at the summit with President Trump in Singapore. I will work closely with my colleagues here at the State Department and throughout the U.S. Government, as well as our allies and partners around the world, to achieve our shared goal of a safer and more peaceful world.


	Once again, I’m honored and grateful for this opportunity, and I look forward to faithfully representing the United States of America. Mr. Secretary, I will give you and the American people my very best. Thank you.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Great. Thank you, sir. Thank you, all.

	The last ceasefire in Afghanistan revealed the deep desire of the Afghan people to end the conflict, and we hope another ceasefire will move the country closer to sustainable security. The United States and our international partners support this initiative by the Afghan people and the Afghan government, and we call on the Taliban to participate. It is our hope, and that of the international community, that the Afghan people may celebrate Eid al-Adha this year in peace, free from fear.


	The United States supports President Ghani's offer for comprehensive negotiations on a mutually agreed agenda. ‎We remain ready to support, facilitate, and participate in direct negotiations between the Afghan government and the Taliban. There are no obstacles to talks. It is time for peace.

	Today, on World Humanitarian Day, we recognize the commitment and dedication of humanitarian aid workers who risk everything to serve those in need, and we honor those who have lost their lives to protect the world’s most vulnerable people.


	The United States has a long and distinguished history of helping people in need as a result of conflict and natural disasters. In FY 2017 alone, the United States provided more than $8 billion in life-saving humanitarian assistance, including food, shelter, healthcare, education, sanitation, and much more to tens of millions crisis-affected people worldwide. As global displacement has reached record levels, we depend on the dedication of humanitarian workers around the world to deliver assistance.


	We applaud the bravery and commitment displayed every day by humanitarian aid workers, even though they face unpredictable and sometimes dangerous challenges to carry out their work. Nearly 200 aid workers worldwide have been killed, injured, or kidnapped since the start of 2018. Among them were those killed in the vicious attack on the provincial Refugee Department in Jalalabad Afghanistan on July 31, as well as numerous aid workers killed or kidnapped in targeted attacks in South Sudan, Somalia, Syria and many other countries.


	On this World Humanitarian Day, the United States remains committed to saving lives and we recognize the tremendous service of all humanitarian heroes, including the many brave aid workers and partners on the ground who work tirelessly every day to help people in need.

	We know that many Indians will reflect on Prime Minister Vajpayee’s many contributions that led to India’s rise as a global and economic power. He championed tirelessly for his country’s development and demonstrated a devotion to improving the lives of every Indian. Standing before the United States Congress in 2000, he famously characterized U.S.-India ties as a “natural partnership of shared endeavors."" He recognized early on that the United States and India, based on their shared democratic values, could develop a partnership that would contribute to the economic prosperity and security of the region and the world. Today, our two countries and our bilateral relationship continue to benefit from Prime Minister Vajpayee’s vision, which helped promote expanded cooperation.

SECRETARY POMPEO: Good afternoon, everyone. Today I am happy to announce the creation of the Iran Action Group.


	The Iran Action Group will be responsible for directing, reviewing, and coordinating all aspects of the State Department’s Iran-related activity, and it will report directly to me.


	For nearly 40 years, the regime in Tehran has been responsible for a torrent of violent and destabilizing behavior against the United States, our allies, our partners, and indeed the Iranian people themselves. In May of this year, President Trump withdrew from the flawed Iran nuclear deal, which failed to restrain Iran’s nuclear progress or its campaigns of violence abroad. In its place President Trump has instituted a campaign of pressure, deterrence, and solidarity with the long-suffering Iranian people.


	Our hope is that one day soon we can reach a new agreement with Iran. But we must see major changes in the regime’s behavior both inside and outside of its borders. The Iranian people and the world are demanding that Iran finally act like a normal nation.


	The Iran Action Group will drive daily progress on these objectives and I hope do much more.


	We are committed to a whole-of-government effort to change the Iranian regime’s behavior, and the Iran Action Group will ensure that the Department of State remains closely synchronized with our interagency partners. The IAG will also lead the way in growing efforts with nations which share our understanding of the Iranian threat. President Trump is making our Iran strategy a true multinational undertaking, and the Iran Action Group will be key to further progress in that regard.


	I am also announcing that Brian Hook will lead the Iran Action Group with the formal title of Special Representative for Iran. Brian has served as the Director of Policy Planning here since February of 2017, and he has worked tirelessly to advance President Trump’s foreign policy priorities across multiple domains. Brian’s diplomatic expertise and broad experience with Iran policy makes him an outstanding choice to lead the State Department’s Iran Action Group.


	Since the President’s decision to withdraw from the Iran deal in May, Brian has played an important role in shaping our strategy of maximum diplomatic and economic pressure.


	We are going to continue to rely on him and his team to lead our efforts to counter the Iranian regime’s malign activity, to support Iranian voices, and to galvanize international support for our efforts.


	And with that, I’d like to introduce our new Special Representative for Iran, Brian Hook.


QUESTION: Mr. Secretary --


QUESTION: Mr. Secretary, before you leave, do you agree with or were you aware of the decision to withdraw Pompeo’s security clearance, sir?


QUESTION: Brennan.


QUESTION: Brennan.


QUESTION: Brennan. (Laughter.)


QUESTION: But Brian, you can answer that question.

QUESTION: Secretary Pompeo, thank you again for this opportunity.


SECRETARY POMPEO: It’s great to be with you.


QUESTION: It’s such a pleasure to have you here in Jakarta, Indonesia.


SECRETARY POMPEO: It’s wonderful to be here.


QUESTION: I understand this is your first visit.


SECRETARY POMPEO: It’s my first trip to Jakarta (inaudible).


QUESTION: Okay, so I want to start off with your visit here to Indonesia. I know that Indonesia and the U.S. will mark its 70th year in diplomatic relations next year. How would you describe the current relationship between Indonesia and the U.S.?


SECRETARY POMPEO: It’s wonderful and important for the United States, an incredibly strategic relationship – two of the world’s largest democracies, now 70 years of diplomatic relations. I think we do wonderful things with our support of Indonesia, and right back Indonesia does great things that are important for the American people too. It’s a strong relationship. The leadership here works closely with our team, and we are doing great things together.


QUESTION: Okay. Indonesia is also home to the largest Muslim population in the world, and it’s a functioning democracy, which the U.S. Vice President Mike Pence praised during his visit here to Indonesia. Why is this the kind of democracy that the U.S. supports?


SECRETARY POMPEO: So we support democracies all across the world; it’s really important. This is a country that has demonstrated the capacity to elect officials, hold democratic processes, the kinds of values that America has embraced since its beginning, and it’s wonderful to have a strategic partner like Indonesia who demonstrates that value set as well.


QUESTION: In terms of democratic stability, how important is democratic stability in Indonesia, and how does it play – how does it play as a role in maintaining regional stability?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Yeah, it’s a great – it’s a great beacon for the rest of the region. The democratic value set that’s here in Indonesia shows the region and the world that you can have democracy and be successful. We always think that’s important. We’re convinced that this model of governance – the democratic model, where you have individuals with human dignity and freedom and all the rights that accrue by being a human being – makes for countries that are incredibly successful and a great partner for the United States.


QUESTION: Okay. In terms of trade and investment, Secretary, what is the kind of trading partner that the U.S. expects out of Indonesia? What are the areas of concern that the U.S. has against Indonesia?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Indonesia has long been a great trading partner. President Trump wants to trade with Asia. He wants to trade with Indonesia. We think the trade between our two countries is incredibly important. We do want to make sure when we’re trading, we’re doing it in a way that is fair and reciprocal, that respects the people of each of the two countries, and I’m convinced that our two countries will continue to do that in a way that benefits the American people and, importantly, the Indonesian people as well.


QUESTION: The reason why I’m asking you this is because we’re watching closely, and the world, including Indonesia, is concerned about the trade war unfolding between the U.S. and China. What does the U.S. expect out of this?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Well, remember, the country that has the high tariffs and the high barriers is China, not the United States. The country that attempts to use its economic power to dominate this region is China, not the United States. We simply want free and open, fair trade, reciprocal trade; and when we do that, we are confident that we will be a great partner. We have no intention of dominating Indonesia. China will always have a role here. We want to be a great partner for Indonesia so that they can continue to have all the successes that the Indonesian people deserve.


QUESTION: And going back into the investment climate here in Indonesia, I wanted to ask you about the Freeport-McMoRan deal that was recently concluded between the Indonesian Government and Freeport. Do you think the deal was a win-win situation for both sides?


SECRETARY POMPEO: You know, I don’t want to comment on a particular dispute, but we should always strive to make sure that our countries or the businesses working in your country get outcomes that benefit both. It’s got to be successful for any Indonesian business to invest in America; the same thing for an American company that invests here. But it needs to be a deal that is good for the people of the country in which that business is being done as well. So I’m confident that the Indonesian country will get to a place where we will have a win-win outcome for both the Indonesian people and the business.


QUESTION: Next year Indonesia will hold its –


SECRETARY POMPEO: Big election year.


QUESTION: Big election year, presidential election. How closely is the U.S. watching this election next year, and what are your thoughts about the leading contenders – Joko Widodo and Prabowo Subianto?


SECRETARY POMPEO: I’m going to go meet the current leader here today. I am very much looking forward to that. He’s done good work. But we don’t engage in choosing candidates; the Indonesian people engage in choosing candidates. And I am very confident we’ll have a good election, a fair election, where candidates will compete and demonstrate why they’re the right leader for the country, and that’s what America is counting on.


QUESTION: I have one more question about Iran, just a really quick question.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Sure.


QUESTION: You know, this is something that we’re closely watching as well. From what I understand, President Trump is looking to meet with Iran’s President Rouhani. From what I understand, he declined to meet. Does this mean that the negotiations have failed, and what will the U.S. do next?


SECRETARY POMPEO: The Islamic Republic of Iran, a Shia-dominated government, has treated its people very poorly, and that’s led to terror. They’re the world’s largest state sponsor of terror. That’s what America is trying to get Iran to stop doing. That’s the behavioral change that we’re looking for from the Iranian regime.


	Whether there is a deal that could be had or whether discussions are appropriate, the President has always said he is prepared to talk, but it’s important that Iran has to be committed to changing its ways in order for those discussions to prove of any value.


QUESTION: Thank you. Thank you very much, Secretary Pompeo.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Thank you very much. It’s wonderful to be with you. Yes, ma’am, thank you.

PRESIDENT WIDODO: (Via translation). Indonesia is the largest country in Southeast Asia and also the country with the largest Muslim population in the world. We are also proud that democracy is growing rapidly in Indonesia. The challenge faced by all nations today is how to maintain diversity and respect each other. Indeed, I continue to develop diversity.

"August 5, 2018","
SECRETARY POMPEO: So a couple thoughts as we get started. First, from the trip, I think we accomplished the objectives we set out: a chance to meet a number of foreign ministers I’ve not met before; we got a chance to share with them three or four things, primarily the United States commitment to the region, something I spoke about a week ago now on Monday; to lay out for them a little more detail how it is the case we intend to ensure that the Indo-Pacific region is free and open. And I think they appreciated hearing that directly from me in private settings where we could talk about what that really meant for them and for their country.


	The second, we got to bring them up to speed on the progress, places we haven’t made progress on North Korea, and our plan moving forward, including the need for each of them to continue to enforce the UN Security Council resolutions and what that meant and what our expectation was for every country who – part of the UN who had voted for those Security Council resolutions.


	I’m happy – other questions – everybody saw there was an earthquake where we took off from, 7.0 earthquake in Indonesia just after we took off. I think 37 now reported – we don’t have confirmations, but multiple deaths.


QUESTION: Any Americans?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Don’t have any – I don’t have any information beyond that yet. All of the government personnel are accounted for, but we don’t have confirmation whether there were American citizens there. Do you have any (inaudible)?


MS NAUERT: Not just yet, sir. (Inaudible.)


SECRETARY POMPEO: Yeah, I hadn’t seen anything yet either.


	And then tomorrow’s an important day. I’ve talked a lot about the world’s largest state sponsor of terror. Tomorrow the first set of waivers associated with the wind-down period after the President’s decision to withdraw from the JCPOA will take effect. The White House will have an announcement sometime tomorrow morning about that, how we’re actually going to handle that as well, but it’s an important part of our efforts to push back against Iranian malign activity.


	Anyway, there you go. There’s three thoughts. Happy (inaudible).


QUESTION: On Iran – on Iran, do you know – Foreign Minister Zarif was really working the room there this last week at ASEAN, and he seemed to be – according to his tweets, he seemed to be suggesting – he was talking to a lot of people about ways to evade sanctions, which he – U.S. sanctions he described – he characterized them as extortion and the U.S. being addicted to sanctions. I was wondering if you thought he made any progress and it’s going to be difficult to get everyone to go along with both the ones tomorrow and the ones coming up in November.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Yeah, so the President and I too have been very clear. We’re very hopeful that we can find a way to move forward, but it’s going to require enormous change on the part of the Iranian regime. They’ve got to – well, they’ve got to behave like a normal country. That’s the ask. It’s pretty simple. And so we think most other countries – everyone with whom I spoke understands that they need to behave normally, and they understand that this is a country that threatens them. Right, we’ve got assassinations taking place in Europe, we’ve got – I could go through the list of malign activity throughout the region. It’s – these folks are bad actors and the President is determined to change their direction. Of course, I think he said this morning, hey, we’re happy to talk if there’s an arrangement that is appropriate that can lead to a good outcome. Perhaps that’ll be the path the Iranians choose to move down. But there’s no evidence to date of their desire to change and behave in a more normal way.


QUESTION: Will they be able to break sanctions, though?


SECRETARY POMPEO: The United States is going to enforce these sanctions. We’re going to enforce these sanctions. (Inaudible.) Just go look at the reporting on what’s taking place. The Iranian people are not happy – not with the Americans, but with their own leadership. They’re unhappy with the failure of their own leadership to deliver the economic promises that their leadership promised them. This isn’t – this is just about Iranians’ dissatisfaction with their own government, and the President’s been pretty clear. We want the Iranian people to have a strong voice in who their leadership will be.


QUESTION: (Inaudible) Korea. Were you concerned about the foreign minister’s – Foreign Minister Ri’s intervention just after you left? It’s – he seemed to put a rather negative (inaudible).


SECRETARY POMPEO: Well, you compare it to last year.


QUESTION: (Off-mike.)


SECRETARY POMPEO: Foreign minister made very clear their continued commitment to denuclearize. I think that was – I don’t – probably don’t have his words exactly right, but it’s pretty close. Compare the anger, frankly, over years and years, and hatred spewed by the North Koreans. This was – his comments were different, and put the comments aside for a minute. The mission statement’s very clear. The UN Security Council has said they must end their nuclear program and their ballistic missile program.


QUESTION: You said there’s a lot of work to do towards the –


SECRETARY POMPEO: I’m sorry.


QUESTION: You said there’s still a lot of work do towards denuclearization.


SECRETARY POMPEO: He’s got to deliver on the commitments he's made.


QUESTION: But why (inaudible) the opportunity of being in Singapore with him to have a proper meeting and go forward, to move forward (inaudible)?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Yeah, you – your question has a predicate, and I’m just going to say there are lots of conversations taking place.


QUESTION: (Inaudible.) Did you meet him?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Lots of conversations taking place. You want to ask again?


QUESTION: Yeah.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Lots of conversations taking place.


QUESTION: In (inaudible) comments, though, he brought up again the North Korean demand for this phased approach, and I know that you’ve said that some things are possible before the end, but not sanctions.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Yeah. That’s right.


QUESTION: So do they have a specific non-sanctions, for lack of a better word, concession that they would like to see before?


SECRETARY POMPEO: I know where you’re headed. I’m not going to comment on the negotiations and what others may have proffered or what we have considered. Just not appropriate. Wouldn’t be fair to them or to us as we try and solve this.


QUESTION: Okay, but it’s not a non-starter.


MS NAUERT: Okay, last question.


QUESTION: Is it a non-starter?


SECRETARY POMPEO: We’re still – we’re working our way through it.


QUESTION: (Off-mike.)


SECRETARY POMPEO: Go ahead, yeah.


QUESTION: Indo-Pacific. How can – how will you tell these countries about the free and open Indo-Pacific when your country is engaging in a trade war with China and possibly other countries?


SECRETARY POMPEO: That’s – because it’s just not true. It’s just not true. Go look at who’s got all the tariffs and who the non-tariff barriers – it’s China. And the President is trying to reset that. The mission set that the President has set out is he – look, he’s said it: Zero tariffs, zero non-tariff barriers, zero subsidies. How much more free and open one might – could one possibly be? That’s the President’s mission statement. The tariffs, the barriers, you see what they do to U.S. businesses who want to come operate in China. They deny them the same set of rules the Chinese businesses that want to come compete in America – we welcome them. We are open, and they need to be the same. We need fair and reciprocal responses from China. That’s what I told every one of my counterparts: America’s objective is to ensure that American businesses have the same opportunities to compete in their country that they have in ours, and when we get there, we’ll all go compete and we’ll have free and open trade amongst each of the countries, each of the –


MS NAUERT: All right, guys, we’ve got to go.


QUESTION: Anything on Venezuela?


SECRETARY POMPEO: I’ll take one more, then I’ll –


MS NAUERT: The Secretary has a call.


QUESTION: On Turkey, they retaliated with – oh, heavens, with – they retaliated.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Yes.


QUESTION: You seemed very optimistic during the press conference, or moderately optimistic, that progress would be made with Pastor Brunson. Does this impact that or were you expecting that, those retaliations?


SECRETARY POMPEO: No, no. Going to get Pastor Brunson home, that’s the mission. I think Ambassador Bolton[1] on the shows this morning said it right: We need to return Ambassador[2] Brunson to the United States. We should also remember every time we talk about Pastor Brunson there are other Americans still being held as well. We are as determined to get them home as we are Pastor Brunson. The local employees – want to get them out of the detention that they’re being held in as well. We are – we’re concerned about all of those folks and working our –


QUESTION: Are you still optimistic (inaudible) as long as you had hoped?


SECRETARY POMPEO: We’re working on it.


QUESTION: Anything on Venezuela?


SECRETARY POMPEO: No, not that you haven’t seen in the press. Ambassador Bolton said this morning there wasn’t an American connection. We don’t really have a lot of detail about what took place beyond what you’ve seen and what the – I think the White House has put out so far.


MS NAUERT: All right, thanks, guys.


SECRETARY POMPEO: All right. Thanks, everybody.


QUESTION: Thank you, sir.


SECRETARY POMPEO: All right. We’ll see you on the other end.

SECRETARY POMPEO: Good morning, everyone. It’s been an honor to participate in my first ASEAN ministerial meetings here in Singapore. I want to first thank Foreign Minister Balakrishnan for hosting. We have reaffirmed our strong bilateral relationship, and it’s great to be back in Singapore again after having been here in June.


	We remain grateful for Singapore’s support of President Trump’s successful summit back in June, and we appreciate Singapore’s dedicated efforts to promote a resilient and innovative ASEAN during this past year. I also appreciate the opportunity to have met with Prime Minister Lee to discuss the critically important and strategic U.S.-Singapore partnership.


	And I’d like here, too, to pause just for a moment to offer my condolences on behalf of the United States to the people of Laos regarding the recent unfortunate tragedy and loss of life from the dam breach. We have disaster relief experts on the ground and are supporting Lao authorities and international humanitarian organizations with needed assistance. Our condolences also go to the victims of recent flooding and landslides in Myanmar and the earthquake in Indonesia.


	Throughout my ASEAN-centered engagements these past days I’ve conveyed President Trump’s commitment to this vital part of the world that continues to grow in importance. Security has been a major focus of our conversations. As part of our commitment to advancing regional security in the Indo-Pacific, the United States is excited to announce nearly $300 million in new funding to reinforce security cooperation throughout the entire region. This new security assistance will advance our shared priorities, especially to strengthen maritime security, develop humanitarian assistance and peacekeeping capabilities, and enhance programs that counter transnational threats.


	I’ve also emphasized the importance of maintaining diplomatic and economic pressure on North Korea to achieve the final, fully verified denuclearization of the DPRK, as agreed to by Chairman Kim. It’s worth remembering this isn’t just an American security goal; it is clear our partners and allies within ASEAN know how important the denuclearization of North Korea is for their own security. I called on them to strictly enforce all sanctions, including the complete shutdown of illegal ship-to-ship transfers of petroleum destined for North Korea.


	We have seen reports that Russia is allowing for joint ventures with North Korean firms and granting new work permits to North Korean guest workers. If these reports prove accurate – and we have every reason to believe that they are – that would be in violation of UN Security Council Resolution 2375.


	I want to remind every nation that has supported these resolutions that this is a serious issue and something that we will discuss with Moscow. We expect the Russians and all countries to abide by the UN Security Council resolutions and enforce sanctions on North Korea. Any violation that detracts from the world’s goal of finally fully denuclearizing North Korea would be something that America would take very seriously.


	In addition, while here at ASEAN I raised concerns about Chinese militarization of the South China Sea and the importance of maintaining a rules-based order in the region. And we discussed advancing cooperation on counterterrorism, including addressing the threat of foreign terrorist fighters returning to the region, and cyber security.


	While reaffirming our support for Myanmar’s ongoing democratic transition, we also addressed the important steps required to resolve the continuing humanitarian crisis in the Rakhine State.


	Progress on these and other critical security issues is essential to a free and open Indo-Pacific. ASEAN will remain at the center of this effort. A free Indo-Pacific is one in which every citizen can exercise his or her fundamental rights without any constraint.


	Regarding the issue of good governance, we regret the elections in Cambodia were neither free nor fair. The Cambodian people deserve better.


	Economically, President Trump recognizes the long-term strategic importance of one of the world’s most competitive regions. The Indo-Pacific has been and will be a major engine of economic growth, and President Trump wants to make sure America and all countries can responsibly reap the benefits of all current and future opportunities. The United States is committed to doing just that according to our values, the rule of law, transparency, and good governance.


	As I said earlier this week, the United States practices partnership economics; we seek partnership, not dominance. Earlier this week at the Indo-Pacific Business Forum hosted by the United States Chamber of Commerce, I outlined the Trump administration’s economic strategy for advancing a free and open Indo-Pacific, and I talked about why U.S. businesses’ engagement in the region is crucial to our mission of promoting peace, stability, and prosperity.


	There is no better force for prosperity in the world than American businesses. When nations partner with American firms, they can have confidence they are working with the most scrupulous, well-run, and transparent companies in the world. As a down payment on a new era in American economic commitment to a free and open Indo-Pacific, I announced at the forum $113 million in new U.S. Government resources to support foundational areas of the future: the digital economy, energy, and infrastructure.


	In addition, the Trump administration is working with Congress to encourage the passage of the BUILD Act. It recently passed the U.S. House of Representatives and now before the United States Senate. Under this bill, the government’s development finance capacity would more than double to $60 billion to support U.S. private investment in strategic opportunities abroad. These initiatives are strategic investments designed to spur our partners’ engagement with American companies, the greatest force for prosperity in the world.


	As part of the $113 million I announced this week, 10 million in funding to support economic programming, much of which will fall under the U.S.-ASEAN Connect program. The United States will continue to work with our partners to foster regional security, fair and reciprocal economic partnerships, and good governance so that independent nations of the Indo-Pacific region can prosper side-by-side in freedom and peace.


	Last year we celebrated 50 years of ASEAN’s success. This year we look forward to ASEAN’s continued centrality in the Indo-Pacific region as we celebrate a fruitful U.S.-ASEAN strategic partnership.


	And with that, I’m happy to take a few questions.


MS NAUERT: Okay, we have time for three questions. The first one – and one question each, please – Tracy Wilkinson from the LA Times.


QUESTION: Hi.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Hi.


QUESTION: Thank you. Okay, so could you talk to us a little bit about how difficult it is or complicated it is to talk to China, to negotiate with China and ask them to help on North Korea, when you are engaged in such a brutal trade war with them?


	And on North Korea you talked about – you called on them, so I’m thinking you actually met with the North Koreans here. Is that true? And you said earlier today that they – that Kim kind of controls the timeline of denuclearization, and so what do you want to see as the next major step there?


	And finally, you’ve mentioned --


MS NAUERT: Tracy, one question.


SECRETARY POMPEO: That’s six by my count.


QUESTION: No, that was just two. (Laughter.) Okay.


SECRETARY POMPEO: So let me start with the first issue you raise, which is the U.S. relationship with China. President Trump desperately wants free, open, fair trade all across the world. All the work that we’re doing in the trade arena is designed exactly for that purpose. President Trump inherited an unfair trade regime where American workers and American companies were not treated reciprocally or fairly by the Chinese, and the efforts of the Trump administration are to right that, to correct that, to adjust that. And I talked with my Chinese counterpart about that yesterday. We also, of course, talked about the importance of enforcing the UN Security Council resolutions, and they made clear their continued commitment to do that.


	Your second question was about North Korea and progress along the way. Chairman Kim made a commitment on June 12th in this very place. He said that he would denuclearize his country. We have been working since then to develop the process by which that will be achieved. We were heartened by the repatriation of the remains of 55 persons, a commitment that Chairman Kim has made. He made a commitment to begin the dismantlement of an engine test site. That work has begun.


	The process of achieving denuclearization of North Korean – the North Korean peninsula is one that I think we have all known would take some time, but I must say from my meetings here the world is united in seeing this achieved. There has not been a single country that hasn’t thanked the United States for its efforts in moving the world towards the possibility of achieving this end-state goal. We’re determined to do it. Chairman Kim is committed to doing it. I am optimistic that we will get this done in the timeline and the world will celebrate what the UN Security Council has demanded.


QUESTION: Did you meet with the North Koreans here today?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Go ahead.


QUESTION: Did you meet with the North Koreans here?


SECRETARY POMPEO: I’ve not met with the North Koreans.


QUESTION: Here?


SECRETARY POMPEO: I’ve not met with the North Koreans here.


MS NAUERT: Next. Next question, Nick Wadhams from Bloomberg.


QUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Secretary. On Turkey, do you anticipate now that Pastor Andrew Brunson still has not been released that the U.S. would consider imposing new sanctions on Turkey? And does the deterioration of ties with Turkey on this issue, but more broadly, threaten Turkey’s membership in the NATO alliance?


SECRETARY POMPEO: I had a constructive conversation with my counterpart yesterday. I made clear that it is well past time that Pastor Brunson be free and be permitted to return to the United States, and the others behind held by Turkey also similarly must be freed as well. I am hopeful that in the coming days we will see that occur, and I don’t want to predict in the future what we might or might do to further enhance the likelihood that that occur. We had a good conversation. I’m very hopeful that we will make progress along that in the days and weeks ahead.


	And more broadly, there are lots of challenges with Turkey but places that, frankly, I’ve worked closely with my foreign minister – the work that – their foreign minister. We’ve – we developed a roadmap for how we would proceed in Manbij – a very contentious issue that existed for a long time. We’ve not only achieved agreement but made actual progress on the ground in implementing that agreement. We’re working diligently, and Turkey is a NATO partner with whom the United States has every intention of continuing to work cooperatively.


MS NAUERT: And our last question goes to Charissa Yong from the Straits Times. Hi, Charissa.


QUESTION: Hi, Mr. Secretary. My question is you said that ASEAN remains central to the free and open Indo-Pacific, but in practice what does that mean? Will ASEAN have a seat at the table for trade negotiations and all of that or free trade arrangement programs, or will it be more of a top-down approach?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Yes, ma’am. Precisely how that will play out will be up to each of the ASEAN countries to see how they will choose to participate in that. As I said, this has been my first trip here to ASEAN and to a ministerial meeting, but it’s not the first time I’ve interacted with nearly each of the countries, my counterparts with whom I’ve had the chance to meet during this trip.


	What I have found from this ASEAN gathering is a deep commitment to work along the United States – along with the United States on the things that are important to each of their countries, to ASEAN, and to the United States. I’ve talked about them here this morning: a free and open Indo-Pacific, a place where every country can have true opportunity to compete, to transit their goods, in a way that is not dominated, not threatened by any one member of ASEAN or any country in the region. That’s important, and it is among those security and economic objectives are very much at the center of what ASEAN has stood for now for over five decades, and I think this particular ministerial moved that forward significantly as well.


	Thank you, all.


MS NAUERT: Thank you. Thank you, everybody.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Thank you, all. Have a great day.

QUESTION: Is America prepared to push the world into a recession because of these trade wars?


SECRETARY POMPEO: America is always going to be a great partner for Asia, Southeast Asia in particular. It’s great to be back here in Singapore; I’ve had fantastic meetings all day with my counterparts, talking about America’s commitment to making sure that we had a free, fair, open Indo-Pacific.


	With respect to trade, that’s what we’re looking for too. We want every country to rise. We want each nation to have the opportunity to trade, to buy American goods, to sell goods into America. These are the things that President (inaudible). We are a radically free-trade country, and President Trump is enormously supportive of that.


QUESTION: But the tariffs seem to be things that are going to put frictions now on that free trade.


SECRETARY POMPEO: What we’re looking for is to remove barriers. This is what has – put in place over decades. There was tremendous unfairness in the system, and our administration is simply trying to put that balance there. The President has said clearly: zero tariffs, zero subsidies, zero non-tariff barriers. Sign us up, we’ll take it. America is trying to reduce friction in the trading system. And when we do, we’re confident that countries like here in Singapore and other places will thrive, as will America.


QUESTION: Is there a timeline, then, for these trade tariffs to be (inaudible) rolled back on? Is there any kind of limit where you’ll say, no, okay, it’s now gone too far?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Well, we’re looking for each country with whom we’re engaging in to fix their own systems in a way that they’re fair, reciprocal, they respect the rule of law – these are the things America’s looking for. We hope it’ll happen sooner rather than later.


QUESTION: And sooner means a time?


SECRETARY POMPEO: We wish it had happened a decade ago. But frankly, the previous administration and the United States wasn’t prepared to make sure that America was treated fairly. And that’s what the President’s looking for. He’s simply looking for open, free trade. We want that with the Indo-Pacific, we want it with Singapore, with Southeast Asia. It’s an imperative. We are confident that when that happens, the global economy will grow, Southeast Asia’s economy will grow, and America will grow as well.


QUESTION: It’s been close on two months since the Trump-Kim summit here in Singapore. Are we closer to a denuclearization of North Korea?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Oh, of course we are. Of course we’re closer. The two presidents came here and made a historic commitment to each other. Chairman Kim Jong-un made the commitment to denuclearize. That’s consistent with what the UN Security Council has been demanding. There are two resolutions that require North Korea to do just that. America, in return, made commitments. We said we are prepared to improve the relationship between our two countries and offer a brighter future for North Korea. We’re still intent upon that. We’re thrilled that North Korea fulfilled its commitment by beginning the process of returning the remains of American servicemen this past week. We hope that process will continue. And we’re confident that Chairman Kim remains committed to denuclearization. The world is counting on it.


QUESTION: But you’ve also said that it’s been imperative that the various countries still maintain the sanctions on North Korea. If so much progress has been made, why not then scale back on the sanctions?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Oh, because the sanctions must remain in place until we’re done. So no matter how much progress we make along the way – by the way, these aren’t American sanctions – it’s important for the world to know this – these are the world’s sanctions. Every country supported the UN Security Council resolutions, and those sanctions will remain in place until we have full denuclearization in North Korea. So no matter how much progress we make, those sanctions will remain in place.


	But that day, that day when we achieve this thing that the whole world is demanding – we welcome that day – a brighter future for the people of North Korea will be at hand.


QUESTION: So you have got nothing to do with sort of a carrot system in which it’s going to be sort of accretionally; you’ll have some sanctions which will scale back as North Korea begins to denuclearize?


SECRETARY POMPEO: The UN Security Council resolutions are very clear. There will surely be things along the way that take place. We’ve already had meetings. We are engaged in things which will improve the trust between our two countries. Those all make sense. But with respect to sanctions, the UN has spoken; the world has spoken.


QUESTION: Time scales. Everybody has – yes, you’re right, everybody’s watching this, but we all want to know: When will this take place? When do you see denuclearization of North Korea taking place? Because having it open-ended just makes everybody incredibly nervous.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Well, the world should be less nervous than they were before the summit between the two leaders, where we were in a very difficult place with frequent missile launches, nuclear testing taking place. None of that has taken place since June 12th. We’re happy about that. The ultimate timeline for denuclearization will be set by Chairman Kim, at least in part. The decision is his. He made a commitment and we’re very hopeful that over the coming weeks and months we can make substantial progress towards that and put the North Korean people on a trajectory towards a brighter future very quickly.


PARTICIPANT: Thank you.


QUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Pompeo.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Thank you very much, Lin. It was great to be with you.

SECRETARY POMPEO: Good afternoon, everyone. It’s my pleasure to chair this year’s Lower Mekong Initiative Ministerial Meeting. I appreciate you all being here today.


	Before we begin, on behalf of the United States, I first want to offer condolences to the people of Laos for the tragic dam breach. I know this is now affecting other countries as well, and we are expressing our condolence to each of them, the people of your countries, and we want you to know that we are glad to work with the Lao Government and others to provide international resolutions and relief as part of this effort. Our condolences also go to the victims of the recent flooding and landslides in Myanmar. Tragedies like this show the importance of working together and supporting each other.


	The Lower Mekong partner countries are important strategic partners for the United States of America. Our increased engagement in LMI has fueled sustainable development and strengthened ASEAN as an institution. Thanks to our teams, LMI has been increasingly responsive to the needs of this subregion, and so I want to commend each of you for your countries’ contributions. Creating equitable, sustainable, inclusive growth for the subregion not only contributes to ASEAN countries and ASEAN’s centrality, but also to a free and open Indo-Pacific.


	A year ago, together we began talking about streamlining the LMI to make it more responsive to the needs of the subregion. Today, with your approval of the restructuring, we will increase the effectiveness of our cooperation. Thailand and Cambodia have both stepped up, volunteering to be the first co-chairs alongside the United States for the two new pillars of the LMI, which will tap into our combined resources and expertise to help achieve our joint priorities.


	Allow me to highlight a few of our recent successes and new programs under the LMI. Our flagship education program, Connecting the Mekong through Education and Training, has given over 44,000 students access to opportunities to learn innovative skills in high demand in the private sector. Another training opportunity comes in the form of the U.S.-Singapore Third Country Training Program, which continues to strengthen ASEAN’s capacity to address modern challenges ranging from cybersecurity to waste management. Our U.S. Department of Agriculture will begin working soon with your governments, regional institutions, and increasingly with the private sector to include cooperation on seed trade in the Lower Mekong.


	I’m also pleased to announce the upcoming launch of our Public-Private Partnership training program for the Lower Mekong government officials to strengthen capacity to develop commercially sound proposals for infrastructure investment. I’m sure we’ll start to see more of these public-private sector partnerships.


	The Mekong Water Data Initiative, which we approved at this meeting last year, is also elevating collaboration among the friends of the Lower Mekong and the Mekong River Commission on the region’s most valuable natural resource. Later today, we will approve the non-binding joint statement on water data management to mobilize resources that can achieve better collection analysis and sharing of water data. The donor members of the Friends of the Lower Mekong are particularly supportive of this commitment as they understand how crucial water data is to mitigating risks related to floods and droughts.


	Through these and many other collaborative LMI partnerships, we can build a stronger and more resilient Mekong region together.


	At this time, I’d like to thank the members of the media for their attention and kindly ask they depart so that we may continue our discussions.

	I would like to thank you, Foreign Minister Balakrishnan, for Singapore’s warm welcome, both here and back in June, and for its leadership as this year’s ASEAN chair.


	On behalf of the United States, let me also offer my condolences to the people of Laos for the loss of life and devastation caused by the dam breach. The U.S. Government is providing assistance to respond to this disaster, and we welcome the support already provided by the ASEAN Humanitarian Assistance Center. I would also like to express my condolences to Indonesia, where a powerful earthquake struck; and to Myanmar, for the casualties suffered in recent flooding and landslides.


	The United States is a Pacific nation, and we remain committed to ASEAN centrality under our Indo-Pacific strategy. Earlier this week, on Monday, I gave remarks on the Indo-Pacific and announced new United States commitments to the region. This included a $113 million down payment on a new era in U.S. economic commitment to peace and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific.


	Last year, we celebrated ASEAN’s 50th anniversary, as well as 40 years of U.S.-ASEAN relations. We look forward to broadening and deepening our Strategic Partnership.


	Over the first year and a half of this administration, President Trump attended his first U.S.-ASEAN Summit and the East Asia Summit in Manila; Vice President Pence visited the ASEAN Secretariat; and numerous cabinet secretaries traveled to the region, including my own recent travel to Vietnam. I expect and am eager for this frequent engagement to continue.


	Our economic engagement has created hundreds of thousands of jobs on both sides of the Pacific. ASEAN is the number one destination for U.S. investment in Asia and ASEAN member-states have increased their investment into the United States by over 1,300 percent between 2004 and 2016. Our policy cooperation on issues like ICT, energy, transportation, and agriculture is also developing rapidly.


	On security, we appreciate ASEAN’s ongoing efforts to promote peace and stability in the region, support the rule of law in the South China Sea, and to strictly enforce sanctions on North Korea. We are also working with ASEAN member-states to counter the threat of terrorism and violent extremism in the region.


	In terms of ASEAN’s socio-cultural issues, we are building capacity among ASEAN’s youth, building opportunities for women, and working to improve disaster response and promote a healthy marine ecosystem. Our cooperation to jointly address cybersecurity challenges has also expanded, and we appreciated ASEAN’s leaders’ first-ever cyber statement in April.


	Again, Mr. Minister, ASEAN colleagues, it’s a great pleasure to be with you here today. I look forward to our discussions and to hearing your thoughts on how the United States and ASEAN can strengthen our ties. Thank you, Mr. Minister.

QUESTION: Thanks so much for doing this.


SECRETARY POMPEO: You bet.


QUESTION: We’re going to talk about the initiatives for the Indo-Pacific region for sure, but first can I start with: The President, during his news conference with the prime minister of Italy, said he would meet with the president of Iran with no preconditions. Are you on board with that? Is that a good idea?


SECRETARY POMPEO: I am indeed. We’ve said this before. We – the President wants to meet with folks to solve problems. If the Iranians demonstrate a commitment to make fundamental changes in how they treat their own people, reduce their malign behavior, can agree that it’s worthwhile to enter into a nuclear agreement that actually prevents proliferation, then the President has said he is prepared to sit down and have the conversation with him.


QUESTION: There were reports last week that they have rebuffed numerous requests from the President. Is that true?


SECRETARY POMPEO: I’m not going to speak about private conversations that may have been had or may not have been had.


QUESTION: The Iranian currency is getting pummeled, and this is even ahead of the snapback sanctions that go into place next week. Are you happy about that? Is that a good thing? Is that going to help bring them to the table?


SECRETARY POMPEO: What we’re looking for isn’t the rial to collapse or anything else for that matter. What we are demanding in a change in the behavior of the regime. You can’t launch missiles into Riyadh. You can’t arm people in Iraq and Syria and Lebanese Hizballah. You can’t fight with Iraqi militias. That’s not behavior that is acceptable from Iran. Those are the changes that we’re looking for, and we’re hopeful that the Iranian regime will see it that way as well and change their behavior.


QUESTION: You announced several new initiatives today related to the Indo-Pacific region. That’s basically the Pacific and India. You described it as a new era. Why? Why are you doing this?


SECRETARY POMPEO: It’s an important region. It’s been an important region for a while, but the Trump administration is taking this incredibly seriously and we’re doing it in a way that’s very consistent with this administration. We want private industry with the assistance of the United States Government, understanding that we’re going to support this effort, we’re going to have private industry go in and develop relationships. When American businesses come to these countries, they’ll thrive. We’ll have contracts that are open and transparent. We’ll form real partnerships with these countries, and we will benefit America for sure, but we’ll benefit each of the nations in the Indo-Pacific by engaging in this way.


QUESTION: When you read the descriptions, if you read the Chinese headlines today, they say this is a counter to One Belt, One Road – this is the massive infrastructure spending plan that China is doing in numerous countries throughout Asia and even into Europe. Is this an answer to One Belt, One Road – what you announced today?


SECRETARY POMPEO: We’re convinced that American engagement in the Indo-Pacific benefits all the nations in that region. We want it to be free, we want it to be open. We’re not looking for dominance. We’re looking for partnerships. Others choose to behave differently. We want these to be commercially available projects led by the American private sector in a way that benefits the entire region and the world.


QUESTION: There’s a reason why some of these countries, though, like to get involved with One Belt, One Road, right? Those contracts are not transparent. They are state-directed. We’ve discovered now since a lot of them got into place that there’s a lot of corruption. Autocratic countries actually like that; they don’t want transparency, they don’t want companies that don’t want to pay bribes. I mean, how do you convince those countries that this is a better option, that the way the United States does things is a better option?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Look, I think some of the countries who have engaged in that find themselves in a place that they are not happy about, and I think the others are beginning to see that as well.


	The way you convince them is that you demonstrate that over the course of history, over the even near term and medium term, that developing relationships with the United States, that having transparency, actually turns out to be better for the leadership and for the people in each of these countries. I’m convinced that history supports that theory, and I’m also convinced that the vast majority of the countries in the Indo-Pacific will agree with that.


QUESTION: The Trans-Pacific Partnership probably wouldn’t have happened regardless of who won; the left and the right seemed to hate it, right. Everybody’s against free trade these days, it seems. But my colleagues in CNBC Asia – and this interview is going to air there in just a couple of hours when they wake up – they were keenly interested in this. And they said, if you really want to have economic influence in Asia, the Trans-Pacific Partnership would be the way to do it. What do you say to them?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Well, the right mechanism is to be determined, but President Trump wants free trade. Make no mistake about it. You suggested that there’s no free traders left; President Trump is an ardent free trader. Zero tariffs, zero subsidies, zero barriers. He’s looking to rebalance these relationships. And as I said, perhaps it’s a multilateral arrangement, but more likely it will be a series of bilateral arrangements. They tend to prove more effective, better for the American people, and they’ll get the outcome that President Trump is demanding. He’s simply looking for fair, and open, and reciprocal trade. And when we get that, we’ll have free trade relationships with these countries that will benefit not only the United States but their countries as well.


QUESTION: Is his methodology making your job harder as a diplomat? The trade war?


SECRETARY POMPEO: His methodology is leading to increased economic opportunity here in the United States of America. That’s always a benefit for any diplomat or any soldier.


QUESTION: One of the countries that’s really gorged on One Belt, One Road is Pakistan – so much so they’ve taken on all kinds of debt. They might actually have to go to the IMF, the International Monetary Fund, for a bailout because they’ve taken on so much Chinese debt. The IMF is funded by U.S. taxpayer dollars – many other countries as well, but if they go to the IMF for a bailout, there’s a chance that U.S. taxpayer dollars are going to go towards Chinese-directed companies as part of that bailout. Are you concerned about that? Are you monitoring that?


SECRETARY POMPEO: So two thoughts. First, there’s new leadership in Pakistan, and we welcome engagement with them in a way that we think will benefit each of our two countries. Second, make no mistake: We will be watching what the IMF does. There’s no rationale for IMF tax dollars – and associated with that, American dollars that are part of the IMF funding – for those to go to bail out Chinese bondholders or China itself.


QUESTION: North Korea is part of the Indo-Pacific region. Numerous times during the whole – all the events around Helsinki – I mean, excuse me, around Singapore – both you, the President, other world leaders refer to the opening of the North Korean economy. Has Kim Jong-un ever actually expressed a desire to have more market forces in his economy? It’s been Stalinist long past Stalin’s death. Is he interested in changing that economy in a way that is fundamental?


SECRETARY POMPEO: He has, and we’ve spoken to him about a brighter future for North Korea. We’ve spoken to him about the importance of allowing private dollars to come in – not just dollars from the United States, although I am confident there will be Americans who would want to invest in an open and rules-based North Korea, but Japanese, South Korean, Chinese too will all want to be part of the economic opportunity that there is in North Korea.


	We’ve told Chairman Kim, if we can denuclearize your country, there is a brighter future for the North Korean people. We’re convinced that he, too, shares that understanding that there has to be – indeed he has directed – better economic times for his own people.


QUESTION: But does he have any belief in market forces at all?


SECRETARY POMPEO: We’ve talked to him about how it is that you grow an economy, that you grow an economy with a private rules-based system and foreign direct investment is the quickest way to fuel economic improvement for your own people.


QUESTION: Anything I should have asked or you expected me to ask you?


SECRETARY POMPEO: I think you covered just about the waterfront, ma’am. Thank you.


QUESTION: Thank you for your time.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Wonderful to see you.


QUESTION: Appreciate it.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Have a good day.


QUESTION: You too.

SECRETARY POMPEO: Good morning, everyone. It’s great to be with you. Thank you, Tom, for the kind introduction. Thanks to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce for having me here and hosting this important Indo-Pacific Business Forum as well. I’m glad to see, too, many American business leaders with us here today. I did this for a long time – people forget that’s what I did for a living before I lost my mind and ran for Congress.


	I know there’s also folks from State Department here and from the administration. I also see a number of ambassadors for – that are stationed here and those from foreign capitals. Thank you all for being here and for partnering with the United States and our businesses as we pursue prosperity for all people across the world.


	I also want to thank my colleagues Secretary Ross, Secretary Perry, Administrator Green, Ambassador Gerrish, Ray Washburne, too, at OPIC, a good friend of mine from my business days. Your president helps – your presence helps solidify our economic approach to the Indo-Pacific as a truly whole-of-government mission.


	I wanted to come here this morning to talk about the Trump administration’s strategy for advancing a free and open Indo-Pacific, and why U.S. business engagement is at the center of it – it’s a staple of our mission to promote peace, stability, and prosperity.


	President Trump first outlined his vision for a free and open Indo-Pacific at the APEC CEO Summit in Vietnam just last year. The National Security Strategy also detailed that vision. Make no mistake, the Indo-Pacific, which stretches from the United States west coast to the west coast of India, is a subject of great importance to American foreign policy. As I will detail in a bit, this region is one of the greatest engines of future global – of the future global economy, and it already is today. And the American people and the whole world have a stake in the Indo-Pacific’s peace and prosperity. It’s why the Indo-Pacific must be free and open.


	And for those of you who might not be familiar with our terminology of “free and open,” I want to just spend a minute talking about what it is this administration means when it uses that language.


	When we say “free” Indo-Pacific, it means we all want all nations, every nation, to be able to protect their sovereignty from coercion by other countries. At the national level, “free” means good governance and the assurance that citizens can enjoy their fundamental rights and liberties.


	When we say “open” in the Indo-Pacific, it means we want all nations to enjoy open access to seas and airways. We want the peaceful resolution of territorial and maritime disputes. This is key for international peace and for each country’s attainment of its own national aims.


	Economically, “open” means fair and reciprocal trade, open investment environments, transparent agreements between nations, and improved connectivity to drive regional ties – because these are the paths for sustainable growth in the region.


	The U.S. commitment to a free and open Indo-Pacific is deeply rooted. The State Department, which I represent, established a consular presence in Kolkata – then called Calcutta – in 1794.


	American entrepreneurs, whom most of you in this room represent, have been trading and investing in the Indo-Pacific even longer than that. And I won’t give you a full history today, but I will note how the United States has played a foundational role in enabling the growth, development, and wealth we see across the entire Indo-Pacific today.


	The great theme of our engagement is this: Where America goes, we seek partnership, not domination. After World War II we worked with Japan to forge a great alliance and stimulate an economic boom. South Korea in the ‘50s was ravaged by conflict. American assistance and investment in railways, ports, and other infrastructure helped create a foundation for our South Korean friends to recover, thrive, and build one of the world’s most prosperous economies – one that is now strong enough to aid other countries in their development.


	In the ‘60s, we grew partnerships to address basic developmental needs. We supported transformational agricultural efforts, such as the Green Revolution, which forever improved farming of wheat and rice worldwide – and nowhere more than in the Indo-Pacific. We helped Hong Kong, Singapore, and other Southeast Asian economies rise from the ‘70s onward. In Taiwan, economic development went hand-in-hand with creating an open, democratic society that blossomed into a high-tech powerhouse. And America was proud to support foundational institutions like ASEAN, APEC, and the Asian Development Bank, among others.


	Thanks to this history of economic and commercial engagements, America’s relationships throughout the Indo-Pacific today are characterized by mutual trust and respect. American friendship is welcomed, and American businesses are recognized for their ingenuity, their reliability, and their honesty.


	Today no country does more two-way trade in the Indo-Pacific than the United States. In Southeast Asia, the U.S. is the single largest source of cumulative foreign investment – larger than China, Japan and the European Union.


	Open a map of the Indo-Pacific today, and it is dotted with U.S. public and private efforts to foster self-reliance, build institutions, and promote private sector growth.


	In the Philippines, Dallas-based Texas Instruments opened a factory in 1979 that helped the country turn into a crucial part of the global semiconductor supply chain. In Malaysia, General Electric first invested in a sales and service center in 1975. Today GE has over 1,300 employees in the country, from Kuala Lumpur to Sarawak. With Malaysians recently having elected a new government, I want them and their leaders to know that America stands ready, as we always do for partners around the region, to deepen commercial, government, people-to-people ties – all based on our shared democratic values. I’ll travel there in the week ahead.


	Chevron was the first company ever granted oil-exploration rights in Thailand, and in 1973 it discovered the first hydrocarbons in Thai waters. This gave birth to a major local industry. Today Chevron is Thailand’s top natural gas and crude oil producer, and its investments support more than 200,000 jobs. Meanwhile, Chevron’s “Enjoy Science Project” trains local teachers in science, technology, engineering, and math to strengthen Thailand’s intellectual capital and help Chevron make greater returns on its investment. Chevron’s Thailand unit even provided equipment and technical advice for the recent rescue of those courageous boys and their coach who were trapped in a flooded cave.


	U.S. companies literally help Indo-Pacific partner nations reach for the stars. SpaceX, one of America’s most innovative firms, recently launched Bangladesh’s first-ever indigenous communications satellite.


	Now, to be clear, the U.S. Government doesn’t tell American companies what to do. But we help build environments that foster good, productive capitalism. We help American firms succeed so that local communities can flourish, and bilateral partnerships can grow.


	That’s why the United States supports educational efforts such as Fulbright University Vietnam and the Young Southeast Asian Leaders Initiative. This is the same kind of commitment we showed in the past when we helped establish the first Indian Institute of Technology, along with 14 regional engineering colleges and eight agricultural universities all across India.


	Development finance is also important. Our Overseas Private Investment Corporation has a portfolio of 3.9 billion invested in the Indo-Pacific alongside American firms in industries from energy to healthcare to banking. For every dollar that OPIC has invested, the private sector has invested $2.76. In Indonesia, OPIC has teamed up with USAID and Colorado-based UPC Renewables to develop the country’s first utility-scale wind farm, to provide clean, affordable, reliable power to 70,000 Indonesian households.


	And our Millennium Challenge Corporation has granted $2.1 billion since 2004 to promote development and good governance in Indo-Pacific nations. Right now MCC is spending 500 million to build hundreds of kilometers of electricity transmission lines in Nepal and realize that country’s energy potential.


	And today, at this Indo-Pacific Business Forum, I am proud to announce that MCC has signed a $350 million compact with the Government of Mongolia to develop new, long-term sources of water supply. In addition to helping Mongolia fulfill a critical human need, this will position the country to attract new investment and stimulate private sector-led growth. I know that the Mongolian foreign minister had intended to be here today, but he was unfortunately called away for business.


	This MCC program will benefit both Mongolia, the region, and the world.


	I could go on much longer and give you more examples. American companies have been a force for prosperity and good throughout the Indo-Pacific region. Our good faith as a partner is evident in our support of economic development that honors local autonomy and national sovereignty. The United States does not invest for political influence, but rather practices partnership economics.


	The successes of the past and present are just a prelude to what I expect will come in the future. I am here to say emphatically that the Trump administration is committed to expanding our economic engagement in the Indo-Pacific region. We seek to capitalize on opportunities in accordance with the principles of freedom and openness.


	As President Trump said in Vietnam last year, the Indo-Pacific is “a beautiful constellation of nations, each its own bright star, satellites to none – and each one a people, a culture, a way of life, a home.” To burn the brightest, this constellation needs the fuel of innovation and sustainable growth. This is what our Indo-Pacific strategy will promote. We believe in strategic partnerships, not strategic dependency.


	As President Trump said last year, “We want you to be strong, prosperous, and self-reliant, rooted in your history, and reaching out toward the future.” Today I echo that message. I speak for President Trump when I say every nation and business can have confidence that the United States will continue to create the conditions for mutual prosperity in a free and open Indo-Pacific.


	It is clearly in America’s strategic interest to deepen engagement in the region. More than one-third of the global population is there. Four of the world’s six largest economies are there as well, in China, Japan, and India – and of course, the United States. The ten countries of the ASEAN community are the fastest-growing economic zone in the world and are major buyers of U.S. products. President Trump will strike while the iron is hot, because there are clear economic benefits at hand for the American people.


	Our Indo-Pacific vision excludes no nation. We seek to work with anyone to promote a free and open Indo-Pacific, so long as that cooperation adheres to the highest standards that our citizens demand. The United States is committed to growing our presence in the region because we want Americans and all people of the Indo-Pacific to share in the economic growth of 2020, 2030, 2040, and beyond.


	I know some are wondering about America’s role in the region in light of President Trump’s decision to pull out of TPP. While we work with our partners to craft better and higher-standard bilateral trade agreements, our companies are continuing to advance U.S. economic interests by growing their presence in the region. For example, the number of U.S. companies in Singapore has increased 10% over just the past two years.


	Finally, we remain committed to economic engagement in the Indo-Pacific because of the national security benefits for the American people and our partners. As President Trump’s National Security Strategy states, “Economic security is national security.”


	It’s clear a big part of America’s international economic future is in this region. So just as the United States made foundational contributions in the past, today I am announcing $113 million in new U.S. initiatives to support foundational areas of the future: digital economy, energy, and infrastructure. These funds represent just a down payment on a new era in U.S. economic commitment to peace and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific region.


	Our strategy seeks to catalyze American businesses to do what they do best. President Trump also expects our commitment to generate greater support for a free and open Indo-Pacific from all countries that share our vision of a region rooted in sovereignty, the rule of law, and sustainable prosperity.


	The first initiative is the Digital Connectivity and Cybersecurity Partnership. This will start with a $25 million dollar initial investment to improve partner countries’ digital connectivity and expand opportunities for U.S. technology exports. The U.S. will support communications infrastructure development through technical assistance and public-private partnerships; promote market-driven digital regulatory policies; and build partners’ cybersecurity capacity to address common threats. We do this because we recognize the tremendous economic and social benefits that come with an open, secure, and reliable internet.


	The second initiative is called Asia EDGE. It stands for Enhancing Development and Growth through Energy. Energy is of course the lifeblood of a modern economy. Through Asia EDGE, we will invest nearly $50 million this year alone to help Indo-Pacific partners import, produce, move, store, and deploy their energy resources. America’s energy bounty includes vast natural resources, world-leading private firms, sophisticated development-financial tools, and peerless technical expertise. We will draw on all of these to grow sustainable and secure energy markets throughout the Indo-Pacific.


	Third, next, infrastructure. The United States is committed to connectivity that advances national sovereignty, regional integration, and trust. This occurs when infrastructure is physically secure, financially viable, and socially responsible.


	So today the U.S. is launching an Infrastructure Transaction and Assistance Network to boost the development of infrastructure done right. This whole-of-government initiative, seeded with nearly $30 million dollars, establishes a new interagency body to coordinate, strengthen, and share U.S. tools for project scouting, financing, and technical assistance. It also establishes a new Indo-Pacific Transaction Advisory Fund to help partners access private legal and financial advisory services.


	In each of these areas – digital economy, energy, and infrastructure – we look forward to working with allies and partners. We also look forward to leveraging the new and modernized tools and improved programming from the BUILD Act that recently passed the House and is now before the Senate. This is a big one. Under the House bill, the U.S. government’s development finance capacity would more than double to $60 billion dollars.


	Let me say another word about money. President Trump – and I know most of you in this room don’t like to waste a single penny – and this investment is not waste. Nor is it about giving money away. This is a strategic investment in the most competitive part of the world for years to come.


	We are proud to support the BUILD Act, and to allocate $113 million dollars in immediate new funds to expand economic engagement in the Indo-Pacific. Later this week, I will make further announcements on security assistance.


	But we also know government spending alone can never address the Indo-Pacific’s needs. According to the Asian Development Bank, developing countries in the region will need $26 trillion for infrastructure by the year 2030. No government nor combination of governments has that kind of money. Only the private sector does. And only if countries make themselves welcoming to private investment will those trillions of dollars get off the sidelines, into their economies, and into productive enterprises that bring jobs and prosperity to their peoples. For that to happen, Indo-Pacific leaders must prioritize transparency, anti-corruption, and responsible financing.


	The U.S. government’s Indo-Pacific initiatives will be shaped by these values and buttressed by partnerships with American companies. This will reflect American values in the high standards, transparency, and adherence to the rule of law.


	With American companies, citizens around the world know that what you see is what you get: honest contracts, honest terms, and no need for off-the-books mischief. Integrity in business practices is an essential pillar of our Indo-Pacific economic vision, and it is what each country in the region needs.


	As I close today I want everyone to understand something: this is a commitment. I personally pledge as the Secretary of State that I will engage with you. I will engage with Congress and our foreign counterparts. So will our Ambassadors and other U.S. officials. I was delighted to make my first trip to Vietnam a few weeks ago, and there will be many more trips to the region even yet this year.


	One such trip starts on Wednesday of this week. I will travel to Malaysia, to Singapore, and then on to Indonesia for the weekend. I look forward to discussing everything that I’ve shared with you today with political and business leaders in the region. ASEAN is literally at the center of the Indo-Pacific, and it plays a central role in the Indo-Pacific vision that America is presenting. This is one reason that out of the $113 million will come a package of U.S. support for important regional institutions, like ASEAN and our ASEAN Connect initiative, APEC, the Lower Mekong Initiative, and the Indian Ocean Rim Association. More on that later this week.


	The Trump administration has a clear vision for the Indo-Pacific in the 21st century. It is an American vision that is deeply engaged in the region’s economic, political, cultural, and security affairs. Like so many of our Asian allies and friends, our country fought for its own independence from an empire that expected deference. We thus have never and will never seek domination in the Indo-Pacific, and we will oppose any country that does.


	Rather, we aspire to a regional order, independent nations that can defend their people and compete fairly in the international marketplace. We stand ready to enhance the security of our partners and to assist them in developing their economies and societies in ways that ensure human dignity. We will help them. We will help them keep their people free from coercion or great power domination.

SECRETARY POMPEO: Good afternoon, everyone. Since the earliest days of his presidency, President Trump has directed his administration to advance and defend the rights of religious freedom at home and abroad, because religious freedom is a universal God-given right to which all people are entitled. It is also an essential building block for all free societies.


	Ensuring religious freedom around the world is a key priority of the Trump administration’s foreign policy. To that end, today we concluded the first ever Ministerial to Advance Religious Freedom. The success of this event was truly unbelievable. The level of enthusiasm from partner groups and other governments was so high that I’ve already committed to doing this again, to holding the second ministerial a year from now.


	This week, we were joined by more than 80 foreign delegations and religious leaders from all across the world who work closely with civil society groups, who are often on the frontlines of reporting and responding to cases of religious intolerance and persecution. I want to thank the dozens of ministerial-level foreign dignitaries that attended. I interact professionally with them every day in the course of diplomacy, but as a man of faith their presence this week was significant to me personally as well.


	Two, we had survivors of religious persecution with us sharing their stories and driving home why this work is so important. The Vice President and I had a chance to sit with a number of them and hear their stories, to talk about why they were working in this field, why religious freedom meant so much to them.


	And also today, Vice President Pence gave a speech to bring attention to the plight of religious minorities of all faiths who are persecuted for what they believe, often by their own governments.


	The Vice President also announced that in the coming months the United States Government will launch a Genocide Recovery and Persecution Response initiative. This is a diplomatic and assistance effort specifically focused on ensuring communities of faith and local organizations are part of the solution in recovering from atrocities. While focused first on our ongoing response to the genocide committed by ISIS in Iraq, our hope is that this program will assist victims in many different places.


	The department was also proud to host several other U.S. senior government officials to speak this week, including Senior Advisor to the President Jared Kushner, OMB Director Mick Mulvaney, and USAID Administrator Mark Green. And tonight, UN Ambassador Nikki Haley will be giving remarks.


	We at the State Department are also undertaking several new initiatives to further the cause of religious freedom around the world. First, as the Vice President announced this morning, we’ve created an International Religious Freedom Fund. This is a joint fund with other nations that will support the work of religious freedom defenders and assist victims of religious persecution.


	Second, we have created a new International Visitor Leadership Program to bring those working on the frontlines of religious freedom issues together, all different faiths from all around the world, to come to the United States. It’s a ten-day project and will focus on promoting religious pluralism and protecting the rights of religious minorities. If you are a champion of religious freedom, be on the lookout for announcements coming soon.


	Third, in just a couple months, the State Department will host a three-day accelerated workshop called Boldline to support and scale innovative public-private partnerships that promote and defend religious freedom around the world. The open calls for proposals is now live on challenge.gov.


	Fourth, we all know that persecution and violence aren’t constrained by borders. We look forward to announcements by several partner countries who have offered to host follow-up regional conferences to explore specific measures that whole regions can take to promote religious freedom.


	And finally, in just a few moments, we’ll release the Potomac Declaration and the Potomac Plan of Action. The Potomac Declaration is a formal affirmation that says right up front that the United States takes religious freedom seriously, that we will work with others around the world to help those under attack for their beliefs, and that we expect leaders around the world to make it their priority as well. The plan of action provides concrete ways the international community and governments can do more to protect religious freedom and to protect vulnerable religious communities in their own countries.


	In closing, I’d like to thank Ambassador Brownback and his staff for their work on this event. What you all have done to put this on is remarkable and an incredibly important moment in America’s support for religious freedom. I want to – I want also to commend the entire State Department for executing an event whose goal is ensuring the sacred right of every man, woman, and child to worship as they please. There is truly eternal significance in the work that we have done.


	I will now invite Ambassador Brownback for a few comments and to take a few questions. Thank you.

SECRETARY POMPEO: Good morning, everyone, and thank you all for being here. It’s an honor for the State Department to host the first-ever Ministerial to Advance Religious Freedom. This event truly reflects President Trump’s ironclad commitment to protecting this important liberty.


	I want to thank Vice President Pence for being here. I know him personally as a man of deep faith, and his dedication to defending religious freedom is unsurpassed. I also want to thank Ambassador Brownback from the great state of Kansas and the entire International Religious Freedom team for executing this vital mission and putting together this incredibly unique event.


	As the first-ever event of its kind, we didn’t know exactly what the response would be. Look around you. It’s fantastic. The reaction has, indeed, been overwhelmingly positive. And I want to announce right now we will do this again next year. (Applause.)


	This year, more than 80 delegations, including dozens of minister-level representatives from around the world, are here today. Thank you for making this cause a priority in your country and thank you for working with us.


	My own faith is of the greatest importance to me personally. As an American, I’ve been blessed with the right to live out what I believe without fear of persecution or reprisal from my government. I want everyone else to enjoy this blessing too. President Trump’s unwavering commitment to religious freedom and the decision to hold this first-ever religious freedom ministerial is not driven by my own personal story, but rather it is rooted in the American story.


	The Trump administration recognizes that religious freedom is a fundamental American liberty, and this has been clear from the administration’s earliest days and indeed the earliest days of our nation.


	The United States advances religious freedom in our foreign policy because it is not exclusively an American right. It is a God-given universal right bestowed on all of mankind. Seventy years ago, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights affirmed this when 48 nations declared that “everyone has the right to freedom of thought, conscience, and religion.”


	The Vice President will speak more about this in a moment, but it bears repeating: millions of people of all faiths are suffering every day. But the Trump administration will not be silent. As part of the State Department – part of that, the State Department will continue the good work it has already done for many years to ensure religious freedom.


	Right now, we remain in conversations with Turkey to bring home Pastor Andrew Brunson. The Vice President will speak more to this as well.


	I’m pleased to announce today the department is providing an additional $17 million of additional demining efforts in the Nineveh region in Iraq. (Applause.) This is on top of the 90 million we have provided countrywide in this year alone. The additional funding will help us make more progress in clearing mines from areas with a large population of religious minorities who were subject to ISIS genocide.


	On that note, I want to recognize the survivors of religious persecution who are with us here today. We honor your personal courage, your depth of conviction, and that you have done so in spite of great violence done to yourselves and to your families. God bless you. (Applause.)


	When religious freedom flourishes, a country flourishes. As one example today, we applaud the steps that Uzbekistan is taking towards a more free society. We have great confidence that a degree of religious freedom greater than before will have a positive ripple effect on their country, their society, and the region as well.


	We’ve seen this too in several Gulf countries. As the region has become an economic hub and attracted foreigners from many faiths, several governments have taken important steps. They’ve been wise to permit the construction of places of worship like churches and temples, thus becoming an even more attractive destination for international investment.


	The State Department’s done a few other things and so has the United States Government. We’ve created a new International Visitor Leadership Program to bring those working on the front lines of religious freedom issues from all around the world to the United States. It’s a ten-day project and it will focus on promoting religious pluralism and protecting the rights of religious minorities.


	Second, in October, the State Department will host a three-day accelerator workshop called Boldline to support and scale innovative public-private partnerships that promote and defend religious freedom around the world.


	Third, we look forward to continuing the important work done today throughout the world. That’s why we are finalizing commitments from several countries who are willing to host regional follow-up conferences on the topic of religious freedom. I want to thank each country that is prepared to help us host that.


	And finally, and perhaps most importantly, later today we will release the Potomac Declaration and the Potomac Plan of Action. These documents reassert the United States’ unwavering commitment to promoting and defending religious freedom. They recommend concrete ways the international community and governments can do more to protect religious freedom and vulnerable religious communities.


	And we will also be releasing several statements on specific countries – Burma, China, and Iran – and specific issues representing some of the greatest challenges to religious freedom in our world today.


	I’m very excited to close by introducing our keynote speaker. Throughout his years of public service, he has made it a priority to be a voice for the voiceless. His commitment to religious freedom assures men and women of all faiths they have a great friend – and a champion – in Vice President Mike Pence. Please join me in welcoming him now. (Applause.)

SECRETARY POMPEO: Good afternoon, Chairman Corker, Ranking Member Menendez, and distinguished members. Thank you for the opportunity to be with you today.


	During my confirmation hearing you asked me to work on a host of world problems, and for 12 weeks I’ve been doing just that. I hope we’ll get a chance to talk about each of those today. For the last few weeks I’ve been engaged in three areas of particular interest to this committee: North Korea, NATO, and Russia.


	On the subject of Russia, I want to bring something to your attention right off the bat today. Today, the Trump administration is releasing what we’re calling the Crimea Declaration. I won’t read the whole thing. I will submit it for the record. It’s been publicly released as well. But one part reads as follows: “The United States calls on Russia to respect the principles to which it has long claimed to adhere and to end its occupation of Crimea.” End of quote.


	I want to assure this committee that the United States does not and will not recognize the Kremlin’s purported annexation of Crimea. We stand together with allies, partners, and the international community in our commitment to Ukraine and its territorial integrity. There will be no relief of Crimea-related sanctions until Russia returns control of the Crimean Peninsula to Ukraine. This Crimea Declaration formalizes United States policy of nonrecognition.


	There’s another indicator of diplomatic progress I want to mention. This morning, Pastor Andrew Brunson, who was imprisoned in Turkey for nearly two years, has been let out of jail at Buca. He’s still under house arrest, so our work is not done, but it’s welcome progress – one that many of you have been engaged in and something the State Department has been working on diligently as well. We will continue to work for the speedy return of all Americans unjustly held captive abroad. President Trump will never forget about our own.


	Our diplomacy on these issues is advancing the goals of President Trump’s National Security Strategy, which laid down guiding principles for American foreign policy in December. In late April, I started executing on the strategy as Secretary of State. And today, on July 1st – excuse me, today here we are, and I want to present you some progress.


	The National Security Strategy established “Protecting the American People, the Homeland, and the American Way of Life” as the pillars of our national security. On July 17th, President Trump stated his firm conviction that “diplomacy and engagement are preferable to conflict and hostility.” These principles have guided our actions on North Korea. President Trump’s diplomacy de-escalated a situation in which the prospect for conflict was rising daily. Americans are safer because of his actions.


	As far as the Trump administration’s goals on North Korea are concerned, nothing has changed. Our objective remains the final, fully verified denuclearization of North Korea, as agreed to by Chairman Kim Jong-un.


	As a follow-up to the President’s successful summit with Chairman Kim, on July 5th I traveled to North Korea to make progress on the commitments that were made in Singapore. We are engaged in patient diplomacy, but we will not let this drag out to no end. I emphasized this position in the productive discussions I had with Vice Chairman Kim Yong-chol.


	President Trump remains upbeat about the prospects for North Korean denuclearization. Progress is happening. We need Chairman Kim Jong-un to follow through on his commitments that he made in Singapore. Until North Korea eliminates its weapons of mass destruction, our sanctions, and those at the United Stations will remain – United Nations – will remain in effect. Multiple UN Security Council resolutions require North Korea to eliminate all of its weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missile programs. Those resolutions were passed unanimously, and they remain binding. We absolutely need every single nation to maintain the enforcement of those sanctions to which every nation is committed. The path ahead is not easy, but our hopes for a safer world and a brighter future for North Korea endure.


	The National Security Strategy also calls for “Peace through Strength.” President Trump’s engagement on NATO has resulted in greater burden sharing that will strengthen the entire alliance against myriad conventional and unconventional threats. Allies have spent more than $40 billion in increased defense spending since 2016, and there will be hundreds of millions of – billions of dollars more in the years ahead.


	Last year’s $14.4 billion in new spending was a 5.1 percent increase. It was the largest in a generation. Eight allies will meet the 2 percent this year; 18 are on track to do so by ‘24. The Trump administration is demanding that every country make its own commitment.


	NATO will remain an indispensable pillar of American national security. We know weakness provokes our enemies, but strength and cohesion protect us. The more every NATO member contributes, the better the alliance can fulfill its mission of deterring threats to each of our nations. This is the increased commitment that the President wants.


	From the outset of this administration, the National Defense Strategy and the Russia Integrated Strategy, our approach has been the same: to steadily raise the costs of aggression until Vladimir Putin chooses a less confrontational foreign policy, while keeping the door open for dialogue in our national interest. Between our two nations, the United States and Russia possess over 90 percent of the world’s nuclear weapons. President Trump believes that two great nuclear powers should not have a contentious relationship. This is not just in our interest but in the interest of the whole world. He strongly believes that now is the time for direct communication in our relationship in order to make clear to President Putin that there is the possibility, however remote it might be, to reverse the negative course of our relationship. Otherwise, the administration will continue imposing tough actions against Russia in response to its malign activities.


	We can’t make progress on issues of mutual concern unless we are talking about them. I’ve heard many of you on this panel say that for years and years. I’m referring to key issues like stopping terrorism, obtaining peace in Ukraine, stopping the civil war in Syria and delivering humanitarian assistance, ensuring security for Israel, and shutting down all of Iran’s malign activity.


	And on the subject of Iran, President Trump has said that “Iran is not the same country it was five months ago.” That’s because our campaign of financial pressure, our withdrawal from the nuclear deal, and our full-throated support for the Iranian people, which I articulated in a speech this past Sunday, are having an impact.


	In Helsinki, we sought to explore whether Russia was interested in improving our relationship but made clear that the ball is in Russia’s court. We defended America’s fundamental strategic interests in Syria and Ukraine, and I personally made clear to the Russians there will be severe consequences for interference in our democratic processes.


	I would also add that President Trump is well aware of the challenges that Russia poses to the United States and our partners and allies. He’s taken a staggering number of actions to protect our interests. As just a few pieces of proof, I’d like to cite the following: 213 sanctions on Russian entities and individuals in the Trump administration; 60 Russian spies expelled from the United States of America and the closure of Russia’s consulate in Seattle in response to Russia’s chemical weapons use in the United Kingdom; the closure of Russia’s consulate in San Francisco, cutting U.S. diplomatic staffing by Russia by almost 70 percent; 150 military exercises have been led or participated in Europe this year alone; more than 11 billion have been put forward for the European Defense[1] Initiative; we made defensive weapons available to Ukraine and to Georgia; and just last week the Department of Defense – this is after Helsinki – added an additional $200 million in security cooperation funds to Ukraine. None of this happened for the eight years that preceded President Trump.


	If it’s not enough for you, there’s a long list. I’m happy to go through that, and I’m guessing sometime today I’ll get that opportunity. I look forward to it.


	Finally, I want you to know President Trump has stated that he accepts our intelligence community’s conclusion that Russia meddled in the 2016 election. He has a complete and proper understanding of what happened. I know; I briefed him on it for over a year. This is perfectly clear to me personally. I am also certain he deeply respects the difficult and dangerous work that our patriots in the intelligence community do every single day, and I know that he feels the same way about the amazing people that work at the United States Department of State.


	Thank you, Chairman Corker.

"July 25, 2018","
	Russia, through its 2014 invasion of Ukraine and its attempted annexation of Crimea, sought to undermine a bedrock international principle shared by democratic states: that no country can change the borders of another by force. The states of the world, including Russia, agreed to this principle in the United Nations Charter, pledging to refrain from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state. This fundamental principle — which was reaffirmed in the Helsinki Final Act — constitutes one of the foundations upon which our shared security and safety rests.


	As we did in the Welles Declaration in 1940, the United States reaffirms as policy its refusal to recognize the Kremlin’s claims of sovereignty over territory seized by force in contravention of international law. In concert with allies, partners, and the international community, the United States rejects Russia’s attempted annexation of Crimea and pledges to maintain this policy until Ukraine’s territorial integrity is restored.


	The United States calls on Russia to respect the principles to which it has long claimed to adhere and to end its occupation of Crimea. As democratic states seek to build a free, just, and prosperous world, we must uphold our commitment to the international principle of sovereign equality and respect the territorial integrity of other states. Through its actions, Russia has acted in a manner unworthy of a great nation and has chosen to isolate itself from the international community.

QUESTION: Mr. Secretary, thank you very much for joining us.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Zoe, it’s great to be with you.


QUESTION: Australia’s foreign minister has raised concerns that the administration’s engagement with Russia could give it a chance to escape responsibility for past behavior. What assurances did you give her on that?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Yeah, there’s no chance that’s going to happen. This administration has been consistent. America has been incredibly supportive of the Joint Investigative Team. We understand what happened with MH17. We are committed to making sure those responsible are held accountable. I told Foreign Minister Bishop that, but more importantly, I’m happy to share with the Australian people – America has the full support. I know the tragedy that that was for so many Australians and their families.


QUESTION: Are you privy to what was said between President Trump and Vladimir Putin and the agreements, as they’ve been described, that were made?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Yeah. I wasn’t in the room, but I’ve had a number of conversations with President Trump. I’ve spoken with Foreign Minister Lavrov. I think I have a very good understanding of what took place between the two leaders. It was an incredibly constructive engagement for President Trump and President Putin, an important one for the world. These are two nuclear superpowers. They ought to be engaged in conversations, and they covered a wide range of topics. They disagreed on many things but also set forward some constructive paths on important topics that can be followed up by those who work for President Trump, myself and others, as well as in a subsequent meeting between the two leaders.


QUESTION: Such as?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Oh, they range from business executives getting together to find places where commerce can be promoted throughout the world. They talked about the important challenges in Syria. We still have over 6 million displaced persons there. How we might find a way to work together in that space to take down the violence level for those families, the incredible strain on Jordan and Lebanon of those – and Turkey for that matter – for those displaced persons, not to mention the tragedy for those human lives. They spoke about Ukraine. They didn’t find much place to agree there. The President was strong in making sure that the world understood that the Minsk path is the right path forward. I could go on. There were many topics across a broad range of places that the United States and Russia encounter each other, and it was very important that the two leaders discussed them.


QUESTION: President Trump’s approach is unorthodox, to say the least.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Well, that’s your word. That’s your word.


QUESTION: And it’s been used by many. I mean, his approach is unusual. You have to admit that.


SECRETARY POMPEO: President Trump is determined to make sure that every day we do the right thing for America’s citizens, and we believe deeply that through that the world will be a far better place. And it is the case that where America has been engaged in the world, citizens in every country have benefitted from that participation, and President Trump is determined to make sure that continues to happen.


QUESTION: Back to MH17 for a moment, dozens of Australians were killed on that plane, three children from one family and their grandpa. What do you say to that family specifically about this approach to reach out to Russia?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Yeah, it was a real tragedy. What the Russians did there is deeply immoral. There ought to be accountability, and the United States is prepared to support the Joint Investigative Team such that that accountability takes place.


QUESTION: Tangentially --


SECRETARY POMPEO: We’ve been at the front of that. We’ve worked diligently on it. We care deeply about it. The previous administration did, too. I give them full credit for that. And we’ll continue to be so.


QUESTION: On Russia, the President’s been highly critical of U.S. intelligence agencies during the Russia investigation. Why should Five Eyes nations like Australia trust U.S. intelligence if the President doesn’t?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Yeah. So I ran one of those organizations for a significant part of this administration. Let’s make no mistake: President Trump values the work that the Central Intelligence Agency does and all of America’s intelligence agencies. He turns to it --


QUESTION: But he’s been so very critical of the FBI.


SECRETARY POMPEO: -- he relies on it, he depends on it, he values it, he loves the people that work for those intelligence agencies, and I can assure you, when I met with our Five Eye partners, they relied on American intelligence as well, and I expect they will continue to do so. They are great, important partners, and the Five Eyes relationships have saved countless lives in Australia.


QUESTION: On North Korea, I was at the Singapore summit, as you were. It was a huge event. How confident are you that Kim Jong-un is still willing to denuclearize, and is there progress still being made?


SECRETARY POMPEO: He made a commitment. Chairman Kim promised. He did so in writing, he did so to the President privately as I understand it, but I also heard him do so in a larger gathering, the third time I’d had the chance to meet Chairman Kim. In each case, he has made clear his intent to denuclearize. Until such time, the world continues to demand that he gets rid of those weapons. They are a threat to the people of North Korea. President Trump’s made very clear that there is a brighter future for the North Korean people. The simple task is to honor the commitment that Chairman Kim made and denuclearize. And we’ll keep enforcing sanctions until that happens. We’ll continue to negotiate. We will try to find the right path forward, but I’m confident that that is the world’s expectation and I’m very hopeful we can deliver on Chairman Kim’s commitment.


QUESTION: On China, what’s the plan for U.S.-Australian collaboration, both in relation to the South China Sea and also to meddling in the South Pacific? Did you specifically discuss any strategic moves on those fronts?


SECRETARY POMPEO: We did. We had long conversations about a free and open Indo-Pacific. Foreign Minister Bishop, Defense Minister Payne, Secretary Mattis, and myself all understand that that is an incredibly important thing not only for countries in the region, the Pacific Island countries, Southeast Asia, Australia itself, but for the United States as well. And we have developed – you’ll see – we’ll put together a document that we will share with the world that talks about the concrete actions we’re going to take to ensure that the free and open Indo-Pacific materializes and continues to be free and open.


QUESTION: And you plan to build up troop numbers in Darwin?


SECRETARY POMPEO: So Secretary Mattis said just a bit ago that the agreed-upon number, 2,500 United States Marines in Darwin, are prepared to go and the timeline for their arrival in Australia will be when the Australian Government says this is the time, this is the sequence, this is the right place, and we have the right missions for them. So yes, we will continue to do that. It’s an important mission for the United States and we know it’s an important mission for not only Australia but the region as well.


QUESTION: You need to go. Very quick, finally, when are we getting an ambassador, and is the President coming to Australia after APEC in November?


SECRETARY POMPEO: So with respect to the ambassador, soon, and --


QUESTION: Soon? What sort of timeframe is that?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Soon. That’s all I can say at this point, but I know it’s important to the United States. I know it’s important to Australia as well. I’ve put it as a real commitment, and we’ll have ambassador – U.S. ambassador to Australia soon.


	The President intends to come. His schedule’s not quite set yet, but I’m very hopeful that that will work into his schedule. It’s very important for all of us to do our best to be physically present. It won’t change – when we’re not physically present, it doesn’t change our commitment, but I know the President would like to be there as well.


QUESTION: Just to wrap up, Foreign Minister Julie Bishop has said that the global order is being challenged on multiple fronts and that the U.S. under President Trump is seen as less predictable and less committed to the international order that it pioneered. Is that true?


SECRETARY POMPEO: No.


QUESTION: What is the truth, then?


SECRETARY POMPEO: The truth is the United States remains committed to ensuring that the global order succeeds, that the world continues to flourish. America is the primary example of what democracy and freedom and the respect for every single individual, the human dignity of every individual – there’s no country that we take a backseat to with respect to that. President Trump is committed to exporting that concept around the world.


QUESTION: And Australia’s still a mate?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Always.


QUESTION: Sir, thank you very much.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Thank you, Zoe. It’s great to be with you.


QUESTION: Thank you so much.

SECRETARY POMPEO: Well, good morning, everyone. I want to first thank Minister of Foreign Affairs Julie Bishop and the Minister of Defense Senator Marise Payne, as well as their team, for joining us here in California.


	Since Secretary of State George Shultz and Admiral William Crowe traveled to Canberra for the first AUSMIN in 1985, our two nations have grown much closer, and I expect that will continue. We’re proud to call Australia one of our best friends and strongest allies. They’re truly that all across the world, and we will continue to work closely together on a range of key bilateral and global issues.


	Secretary Mattis and I have had two great days of meetings with Foreign Minister Bishop and Defense Minister Payne. We coordinated closely on aligning our strategic priorities in the Indo-Pacific and beyond. We also reinforced our commitment to ANZUS Treaty, which came into force in 1951, to coordinate how we meet common threats. I’ll let Secretary Mattis speak more directly on our shared security efforts, but I can say that on that front our cooperation and our efforts and our alliance is rock solid.


	We also strategized on how best to pursue our shared vision of a free and open Indo-Pacific. Both of our countries will continue to work with likeminded partners to protect freedom of the skies and seas, to promote market economies, to support good governance and liberty, and to insulate sovereign nations from external coercion.


	Next week, a week from yesterday, I’ll be articulating more closely and more completely our vision for a thoroughly successful Indo-Pacific economic relationship. I’ll be speaking to the Indo-Pacific Business Forum in Washington along with Secretaries Perry and Ross. But make no mistake about it – the economic relationship between our two countries is strong, whether that’s foreign direct investment, the work that we do on technology together, the fact that we have Australian students here and American students learning there. The economic relationship between our two countries is unrivaled in the world, and I think everyone in the region should know that.


	The United States and Australia speak with one voice also in calling for a final, fully verified, denuclearized North Korea, as agreed to by Chairman Kim. Australia has been a great supporter. They understand that the pressure campaign against the DPRK, including the continued enforcement of sanctions, is an imperative for the world to successfully succeed in denuclearizing North Korea.


	Our teams at Department of State and Department of Defense will keep doing their part to strengthen this alliance that has done so much for our two nations and for the regional and global peace and stability. The United States and Australia both know we can count on each other constantly, even as challenges present themselves in an era of great competition and uncertainty.


	And I’d like to now invite Foreign Minister Bishop to say a few words.


FOREIGN MINISTER BISHOP: Thank you, Secretary Pompeo and Secretary Mattis, for hosting this AUSMIN meeting, our annual Australia-U.S. ministerial dialogue. And both Senator Payne and I were delighted by the warm welcome. We think it is so fitting that it should be here on the West Coast, as we both have a key focus on peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific.


	It was also fitting that it should be held at the Hoover Institution. For the 31st president of the United States, after whom this institution is named, spent a number of his formative years in Australia and was a key player in the establishment and building of our global mining and resources industry. And we’re delighted to be here also because it was near here 67 years ago that Australia and the U.S. signed the ANZUS Treaty.


	So this is an opportunity and has been an opportunity for us to confirm the strength and the steadfastness of our relationship. We reinforced our collective commitment to the alliance, and we spoke about ways that we can continue to work together. We have a similar view on so many regional and global issues, and we are aligned in so many important ways.


	Ours is a partnership about promoting stability and security and prosperity in our region, and we discussed ways where we can continue to work closely together to enhance that commitment, including in economic engagement. We are certainly looking forward to your upcoming speech on the U.S.’s engagement, economically speaking, in the region.


	Over two days and five working sessions, we covered a lot of ground. And we have produced a fact sheet, which sets our joint work plan. These meetings are great opportunities for us to reassess our priorities and then confirm what work we’re going to do together in the future.


	A key focus of this AUSMIN was our commitment to the Indo-Pacific, and this is arguably the world’s most dynamic region. There are many opportunities but also many challenges. The United States is the global bastion of freedom and democracy, and the great appeal of the United States and one of its undoubted strengths is its network of alliances and partnerships around the world. And so as allies and partners, we discussed ways that we can work more constructively with countries in our region, including the 10 members of ASEAN, with China, with Japan, with India, and with the Pacific Island nations.


	We did discuss challenges. And we congratulate the United States on the recent Singapore summit and your efforts in bringing stability to the Korean Peninsula, and we certainly back your efforts in that regard.


	We discussed Middle East conflicts. We discussed our work together in countering terrorism. We discussed foreign interference, the cyber challenges that we face. We also discussed many great opportunities for greater trade and investment. Our two countries are already strong trading partners. The United States is one of our most important if not our most important economic partner, given the level of investment that the United States makes in Australia as well as our trading relationship.


	We enjoyed very much working with you. We’re looking forward to a deep engagement over the next 12 months as we lead into AUSMIN 2019, when we will host you in Australia. Thank you.


SECRETARY MATTIS: Well, thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for being here with us this morning. I was honored to join Minister Bishop, Minister Payne, Secretary Pompeo as we concluded our 28th Australia-United States ministerial talks. And the talks were an excellent opportunity to bolster our relationship – in my case the security relationship – and to reaffirm our steadfast alliance and close collaboration.


	In these past 12 months, we have strengthened our defense cooperation in many tangible ways, finalizing our respective national security and defense strategies to address shared threats and increasing our coordination of joint capabilities development. We’ve enhanced our interoperability and our cooperation in the region through Exercise RIMPAC and numerous other exercises, and that’s continuing our 100-year tradition of teamwork, or mateship as our friends from Down Under call it.


	Minister Payne and I signed a cyber memorandum of understanding to enable our countries to perform research and development and together advance our combined cyber capabilities. And our Marine Rotational Force in Darwin will reach the previously agreed-upon number of 2,500 on a timeline determined by our host nation partner, Australia. These actions, to borrow a phrase from Minister Payne, demonstrate that the United States and Australia will walk the walk in the Indo-Pacific.


	We share the same strategic goal: to ensure a free, open, inclusive, and prosperous Indo-Pacific, where nations large and small are respected and accorded the protection of international law. The joint work plan we put forth today will help bring this goal to fruition with concrete steps to enhance U.S.-Australia cooperation across our governments by further integrating our combined military operations and committing to step up U.S.-Australian coordination and engagement across the region, including the noted Pacific Islands.


	Regarding North Korea, we will keep the pressure on the regime’s denuclearization through the enforcement of the UN Security Council’s international sanctions imposed with the Security Council’s unanimous backing to prevent ship-to-ship transfers of energy supplies. We have also partnered on defense innovation. There we will explore all opportunities for deeper defense industry collaboration now that Australia is included in the U.S. National Technology and Industrial Base.


	Overall, our discussions furthered cooperation on these and more issues, strengthening our response to various security challenges. Ministers Bishop and Payne, thank you for your candor throughout our discussions – an openness only possible between loyal and trusted allies. And Australia has been an unwavering friend standing with us through thick and thin, and it was demonstrated by being the first ally on the ground beside us in Afghanistan following the 9/11 attack on America, an attack that cost 11 Australian citizens their lives during the hit on New York City. And we do not forget the families of your soldiers, fellow ministers. We don’t forget the families of your soldiers who have fallen alongside us. I’m confident our enduring and unflappable mateship will continue to grow and flourish for another one hundred years.


	Thank you. Minister Payne.


DEFENSE MINISTER PAYNE: Thank you very much, Jim. To Secretary Mattis and Secretary Pompeo, thank you very much for hosting us here for AUSMIN 2018. I also want to thank our teams, who’ve worked enormously hard to put this together. These things don’t happen out of the clear blue sky, so the effort that has gone into that we very much appreciate. Fair to say we all feel very secure as well, so thank you very much for that support.


	I want to acknowledge both my friend Ambassador Joe Hockey and my friend Charge James Caruso for their support for AUSMIN 2018 as well.


	This is my third AUSMIN and it’s particularly good to be here in Palo Alto. Jim, I can certainly understand why you loved it here so much, or why you do love it here so much, in fact. But importantly for us and part of our discussion today, it’s also a region that is synonymous with innovation, with collaboration, with U.S. ingenuity and leadership.


	There’s been a lot said in recent times about the history of the Australia-U.S. defense relationship – 100 years of mateship – of the shared history and the shared sacrifice. But it’s also the ability of our two nations to innovate, and for the relationship to evolve that underpins its success.


	Whether indeed it was Monash’s groundbreaking tactics a hundred years ago at the Battle of Hamel when he led United States troops for the first time, or the joint development programs that we’re undertaking today across so many fields – the Poseidon P-8, the Triton, the Growler, just as examples – we continue to innovate and to collaborate to ensure that our alliance is relevant to and, most particularly, ready for today’s challenges.


	Nowhere, in fact, as Secretary Mattis has mentioned, is the need for innovation more critical than in cyber, which continues to be a pervasive threat to our militaries and to our businesses.


	So we have signed an MOU today to deepen cybersecurity cooperation so that we’re able to jointly develop the tools and the software that we need to both protect and defend against cyber threats.


	And just as the challenges continue to evolve, so does the Australia-U.S. alliance. We, however, remain absolutely committed to working with the U.S. to ensure that that alliance remains strong and responsive to emerging threats, especially in our region.


	Together, as Secretary Mattis has said, we continue to work side by side around the world, as we’ve done for the past hundred years, to pursue our shared values and those interests that we hold so dear.


	Indeed, as we speak, more than 1,600 Australian defense personnel are participating in the world’s largest international naval exercise, the U.S.-led Rim of the Pacific, or RIMPAC.


	We’ve all benefitted from the region’s stability for decades. It’s been underpinned by the rules-based global order. And both Australia and the United States are committed to working with our allies and partners throughout the Indo-Pacific to ensure that the region remains open and inclusive and prosperous. And we agreed this week that we will further our cooperation to promote the security, the stability, and the resilience of our Pacific Island neighbors as well.


	Whether it’s through exercises with our allies and partners, or building a regional capacity to respond toward our shared challenges of counterterrorism, of humanitarian disasters, or maritime security. There is much that Australia and the U.S. do do together and can do together to strengthen the security of this region.


	In relation to North Korea, we are very clear that we’re committed to strengthening cooperation to achieve the final, fully verified denuclearization of the DPRK, and of keeping a focus on sanctions enforcement as well. We also discussed the potential repatriation of personnel missing in action from the Korean War following the historic Singapore summit. Australia has 43 personnel missing in action in the Demilitarized Zone and in North Korea. Their unknown fate continues to be a source of pain and mystery to their families. We’ve provided dental records and DNA information from Australia to assist in the identification of any remains that may be provided to the United States. This remains a challenging process, but a very, very important one. I’m sure there are still hurdles to come in that process, but I do want to thank the United States particularly for their assistance.


	Not that we’re necessarily into quoting each other back and forth, but the Secretary did say in our bilateral yesterday that this is a relationship that is never taken for granted. And it is a sentiment very deeply held by both sides. Let me again thank both Secretary Pompeo and Secretary Mattis for hosting us here today, and as Minister Bishop said, we look forward to seeing you in Australia for AUSMIN 2019.


	Thanks, ladies and gentlemen.


MODERATOR: Now for those questions, I believe we’ll start with Fox News. Claudia Cowan.


QUESTION: Thank you very much. Thank you for your comments this morning. I have a question for Secretary Pompeo and a follow-up with Secretary Mattis, if I may. Secretary Pompeo, I know you’re testifying on Capitol Hill tomorrow about the Helsinki summit. What is your understanding of the agreements that were made between President Trump and President Putin there? Have you met with the President to discuss those agreements, and have you seen any change in behavior by the Russians that warrant a second summit invitation in Washington? Do you think that’s a good idea? And then Secretary Mattis, sir, have you been asked to prepare options for working with the Russians in Syria, and do you have any concerns about doing so? Thank you.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Thanks for your question about the U.S.-Australia relationship, I appreciate that. (Laughter.) Yes, look, I’ve spoken with the President about the meeting that he held with President Putin, and I was part of a larger discussion as well. I’ve spoken to Secretary – to Foreign Minister Lavrov following that. And the President’s been clear about some of the things that were agreed to. We’re going to begin to put together a business council, there’ll be places we’ll start track-two processes – there were many things that came from what I view as an incredibly important meeting between President Trump and President Putin, one that I’m – I think the world will have benefitted from when history is written.


	I am looking forward to testifying tomorrow. We’ll testify about a lot of things, including the relationship between the United States and Russia. But I think – I think one of the things that gets lost is the determination that this administration has had in pushing back against Russian malign behavior around the world. It is unequaled in the history of the United States in terms of when there was a post-Cold War conflict between the United States and Russia, how firm this administration has been in pushing back against those threats. And I look forward to testifying about that tomorrow as well. Jim?


SECRETARY MATTIS: Yeah, in regard to Syria, what we do with the Russian Federation is we deconflict our operations. We do not coordinate them; we deconflict them in time and in space to make certain along the deconfliction lines we are not creating hazardous conditions. But we will not – we will not be doing anything additional until the Secretary of State and the President have further figured out at what point we are going to start working alongside our allies with Russia in the future. That has not happened yet and it would be premature for me to go into any more detail at this point, because we’re not doing any more than this.


MODERATOR:  The next question goes to (inaudible) from The Australian.


QUESTION: Thank you. Secretary Pompeo, Minister Bishop has recently expressed concern about China’s creeping strategic and economic influence in the South Pacific. I wonder what you think about this and how the U.S. intends to respond to this. Are you concerned by this? And Secretary Mattis, a U.S. congressman, Joe Courtney, recently said he’d like to see Australia conduct a unilateral freedom of navigation operation in the South China Sea within 12 nautical miles. While respecting that that is Australia’s decision, would you, as defense secretary, like to see Australia do such a thing? And finally, to Minister Bishop, the Australia-U.S. alliance is very strong today, but Donald Trump has proved to be a transactional president when it comes to some close allies. Are you confident that the alliance could withstand any buffeting from an unpredictable president?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Well, I feel compelled to answer your third one too, but I’ll – (laughter) – I’m confident Foreign Minister Bishop can handle that.


	Let me speak to – we spent a lot of time over the course of the last two days talking about how to maintain a free and open Indo-Pacific. That threat emanates from lots of places; certainly China poses concerns there. And we talked about all the various elements of power – economic, diplomatic. You talked about freedom of navigation, I’ll let Secretaries Mattis and – Secretary Bishop speak to that a little more directly.


	But I don’t think anyone should underestimate the United States continued commitment to this. It – we do it in different ways. We’re a democratic society, so our power is projected in ways that are unique and different from the way that countries that aren’t so free and democratic project their power. And I think the South Pacific, like most places in the world, understand the enormity of having an American ally, the enormity of having a country that consistently, over decades, projects the democratic values, the human dignity that comes with having an American partner is different from having partners that aren’t quite that way. And I think over time that will ultimately prevail, not only in the South Pacific, but all across the world. I think the capacity of America as a partner to inspire, and to create a place where we value our partners in a way that is continuous and noble is unique in history, and one that I think the world fully appreciates. Jim?


SECRETARY MATTIS: Well, we’re totally aligned, Australia and the United States, with what we want as an end state in the Pacific, and that is of course the free and the open Indo-Pacific, where nations large and small are treated with respect for their territorial integrity, for their sovereignty, their sovereign decisions. And I think that as we look at the South China Sea, our concern is that features that have never been militarized before have been militarized by the PRC. We’ve been very – over several administrations we’ve been very clear we disagree with that. But as far as freedom of navigation decisions by Australia, that’s a sovereign decision by a sovereign state. And we coordinate, collaborate across the realm in terms of our military exercises, our military operations. And right now, we’ll just leave that decision with the people of Australia, which is exactly where it belongs.


FOREIGN MINISTER BISHOP: The relationship between the United States and Australia is longstanding, deep, enduring, and at this meeting we committed anew to working together in furtherance of our alliance and our objectives. We are committed to an open, prosperous, inclusive Indo-Pacific. We’re committed to the rule of law and the international rules-based order that has underpinned stability and prosperity, relatively speaking, since the United States instigated that rules-based order over 70 years ago and continues to be the defender and guarantor.


	We have already established a very close working relationship with the Trump administration right from the outset. And as we’ve often said, the relationship is so deep and so enduring that changes in the White House and changes in the Lodge in Canberra don’t dent the strength of that relationship. We have a very open and frank dialogue with the United States, with our counterparts, but also President Trump and Prime Minister Turnbull have established a very close working relationship. We don’t always agree with the United States and the United States doesn’t always agree with us, but we are able to work through any differences in a very constructive and positive way, and we’ll continue to do that.


	I want to take this opportunity to thank the United States for the commitment to working with us in relation to MH17 and holding Russia to account over its role in the downing of that Malaysian airline that killed 298 people, including 38 Australian citizens and residents. And that’s just an example of how we rely on the United States and how we are grateful for the support that they give us in relation to a matter that is very dear and personal to the hearts of all Australians.


	So from my perspective – and this is my fifth AUSMIN – from my perspective, the relationship is as a deep and strong as it’s ever been, and I’m certainly looking forward to working with Secretaries Pompeo and Mattis as we work through the fact sheet that I believe has been handed out that just gives you an indication of the breadth and depth and the diversity of the areas where we collaborate and cooperate and will continue to do so.


MODERATOR: Next question goes to Alexandria Sage with Reuters.


QUESTION: Thank you, good morning. A few questions for multiple parties here. For Secretary Pompeo and Foreign Minister Bishop, there are reports that North Korea has already begun to dismantle its facilities at its Sohae test site. Could you confirm that, and what moves – further moves would you like to see and how soon?


	Then for Secretary Mattis, if I may, the President’s tweet on Iran suggested a possible military strike. Where do you see the red line that Iran would have to cross for the U.S. to engage in military force, and are you concerned about some miscalculation between U.S. and Iranian forces in the region based on this escalating rhetoric?


	Finally, if I may, Foreign Minister Bishop, could you please update us as to how recently you may have been in touch with authorities in Myanmar for the release of our Reuters colleagues who have been tortured under custody? Thank you.


SECRETARY POMPEO: So let me take the first one first, and then I’ll turn it over to Secretary Mattis. So we’ve seen the open press reporting about the missile engine test site. It’d be entirely consistent with the commitment that Chairman Kim made to President Trump when the two of them were in Singapore together. He made that commitment to them orally. We’ve been pressing for there to be inspectors on the ground when that engine test facility is dismantled consistent with Chairman Kim’s commitment, and I’ll leave it at that for this morning.


	The second part of your question was what further steps would you like to take. That’s easy. They need to completely, fully denuclearize. That’s the steps that Chairman Kim committed to and that the world has demanded through UN Security Council resolutions. It’s that straightforward.


SECRETARY MATTIS: Yeah, on Iran, I think that what we have to look at is the destabilizing influence that Iran has consistently portrayed and demonstrated throughout the region. And the only reason that the murderer Assad is still in power – the primary reason – is because Iran has stuck by him, reinforced him, funded him. We see the same kind of malfeasance down in Yemen, where they’re fomenting more violence down there. We’ve seen their disruptive capabilities demonstrated from Bahrain to the kingdom. And it’s time for Iran to shape up and show responsibility as a responsible nation. It cannot continue to show irresponsibility as some revolutionary organization that is intent on exporting terrorism, exporting disruption across the region. So I think the President was making very clear that they’re on the wrong track.


FOREIGN MINISTER BISHOP: In relation to North Korea, Australia stands firmly with the United States and the international community in holding North Korea to abide by the numerous UN Security Council resolutions that banned its nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs, and we will offer whatever support we can in the process of verifying the complete dismantling of those programs. In the meantime, we will continue to enforce the sanctions and assist in the enforcement regime to ensure that North Korea is held to the promises it’s made to the President and to the United States about denuclearization. We’re all seeking stability and security on the Korean Peninsula, and the full and verifiable denuclearization of North Korea is fundamental to that.


	In relation to the two Reuters journalists that have been detained in Myanmar, our officials have attended every one of the hearings that have taken place. We are aware that the judge has now committed the two journalists to trial. We are in contact with the journalists’ lawyers and we will continue to make representations through our embassy in Myanmar to the government. Of course, there is a judicial process, a legal process, underway, but we are maintaining a very close eye on this particular case because it does go to the whole question of the freedom of the press in Myanmar and the integrity of its legal system. But we are working very closely with other likeminded countries on this and we will continue to be present through our representatives at each of the court hearings. And we’ll also continue to make representations through our contacts with the Myanmar Government.


MODERATOR: Last question is to Ashlee Mullany with Channel 7.


QUESTION: Secretary Pompeo, I have a question today from Anthony Maslin and Marite Norris of Perth, Western Australia. Their young children, Mo, Evie, and Otis, were murdered on flight MH17, along with their grandfather and 294 other innocent people.


	This is a question on their behalf in their words: That the plane was hit by a Russian missile has been proven to be an irrefutable fact. That this killed our three beautiful children and their grandfather and destroyed our life and many other lives has been proven to be – is, rather, an irrefutable fact. Secretary Pompeo, will the United States, our friend and ally, help Australia hold Russia to account, and how?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Well, I appreciate the question from you – from them. It’s – my condolences to their family. It’s, indeed, a tragedy. The United States has already been a great partner for the Netherlands and for Australia in trying to identify who shot down this plane. We need the Russians to continue to be held accountable for that. We take this matter seriously and we committed over these last two days, as we have for the last months, to continue to support every effort through the Joint Investigative Team to hold the perpetrators for this heinous activity accountable. You have America’s support in that and will continue to do so.

","Press Availability With Secretary of Defense James Mattis, Australian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop, and Australian Defense Minister Marise Payne",http://www.state.gov/secretary/remarks/2018/07/284471.htm
"July 24, 2018","
	Last month, Mohammad Salas, a member of the Iranian Gonabadi Sufi dervish community persecuted by the Iranian regime for its beliefs, was convicted and sentenced to death on questionable grounds following violent clashes between security forces and Gonabadi dervishes. Mr. Salas and his supporters maintained his innocence, reportedly stating he had been tortured into a forced confession. Sadly, on June 18 the regime hanged Mr. Salas in the notorious Rajai Shahr Prison.


	Salas’s death was part of a larger crackdown on Gonabadi Sufi Muslims that began in February. Hundreds of Sufi Muslims in Iran remain imprisoned on account of their beliefs, with reports of several dying at the hands of Iran’s brutal security forces. The religious intolerance of the regime in Iran also applies to Christians, Jews, Sunnis, Baha’is, Zoroastrians, and other minority religious groups simply trying to practice their faiths.


	Around the world, adherents from innumerable faith backgrounds suffer similar violations of their most fundamental human rights. Earlier this year, the State Department hosted six United States-based Uighur journalists with Radio Free Asia’s Uighur Service. Their reporting indicates that Chinese authorities are likely detaining, at least, hundreds of thousands of Uighurs and other Muslim minorities in internment camps in Xinjiang. One journalist, Gulchehra Hoja, shared that 23 of her family members have been detained in the region. She, like others, have little to no information about her family’s well-being.


	In Burma, since August 2017, nearly 700,000 Rohingya have been forced to flee to Bangladesh because of an ethnic cleansing campaign carried out by the Burmese security forces. Reports have indicated children, elderly, and infirm persons were burned alive in houses.


	And in Sudan, the government demolished a Presbyterian Evangelical Church in February after police ordered congregants to vacate it after Sunday worship services without any advanced warning. This attack was the latest government-ordered church demolition to have occurred in the country.


	These episodes and others like them are abhorrent. Religious freedom is a God-given right to which all people are entitled. That is why President Donald Trump is taking action to protect religious freedom around the world. It belongs to all people, everywhere.


	On July 24-26, the State Department will bring together religious leaders, civil society groups, survivors of religious persecution, and delegations from foreign governments for the first-ever Ministerial to Advance Religious Freedom in Washington, D.C. Vice President Mike Pence and other senior Trump administration officials will also be participating. Our goal is simple: to promote the God-given human right to believe what you want to believe.


	To advance the cause of religious freedom, we need all these voices to work together.


	We need civil society groups, who are often the first to hear reports of violations, to continue their courageous work on the front lines.


	We need religious leaders of every faith to articulate to their adherents that violence is not a righteous way to propagate belief.


	We need governments to recognize religious discrimination and persecution, take a firm stand against it, and treat religious freedom as a foreign policy priority.


	And we need to hear the stories of those persecuted, tortured, falsely imprisoned, and killed for their faith. We can honor their sacrifices by preventing these atrocities from happening again.


	Promoting religious freedom for all not only advances the interests of individuals, but countries and faith groups around the world. Where fundamental freedoms of religion, speech, press, and peaceful assembly exist, ideas compete with one another and different views are discussed openly. Greater understanding comes from this free exchange. Countries that champion individual freedoms are often the most secure, economically vibrant, and prosperous in the world. Religious freedom is an indispensable building block of free societies.


	The Trump administration is passionate about promoting and defending international religious freedom. But the challenge is too big for any one nation. We need every country to protect and defend freedom of religion for everyone. I look forward to welcoming my counterparts to the U.S. State Department as we fight for the persecuted, speak out for the voiceless, and work together to pave the way for greater religious freedom around the world.

	On behalf of the Government of the United States of America, I offer warm congratulations to the Government and the people of Egypt on your National Day, July 23. We join you in celebrating Egypt’s unparalleled history, its rich and fascinating cultural heritage, and its essential role in regional peace, security, and stability.


	The deep commercial, security, and people-to-people relationships between our two countries are rooted in mutual interest and respect, as well as our shared commitment to combatting terrorism and fostering the conditions for prosperity. I look forward to further developing our multi-faceted relationship.

	We congratulate the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) on their successful operations to liberate al-Dashisha, Syria, from the scourge of ISIS. Dashisha since 2013 has been a key stronghold and transit route for ISIS fighters, weapons, and suicide bombers between Syria and Iraq. The SDF now controls the area, with Iraqi Security Forces controlling the Iraqi side of the border. This is a significant milestone.


	The SDF ground offensive cleared over 1,200 square kilometers in the Dashisha area. The offensive was part of our Coalition-backed effort to clear the last pockets of ISIS-held territory in the Middle Euphrates River Valley and the Iraq-Syria border region.


	We commend the bravery and sacrifice of the Syrian Democratic Forces. We also commend the significant efforts of the Iraqi Security Forces to ensure that ISIS could not flee into Iraq and the artillery and air support provided during key moments of the operation.


	The liberation of Iraq and ISIS’s losses in Syria are major achievements but our mission is not complete. Destroying ISIS continues to be an urgent priority for President Trump and the Administration. Last week, I convened 53 members of our Coalition to Defeat ISIS to discuss the next phase of the campaign and the imperative for coalition burden sharing, particularly with respect to stabilizing liberated areas.


	We are grateful for the significant contributions received to date, and look for these contributions to accelerate as our partners in the SDF prepare for the next phase of operations against the few remaining ISIS strongholds in Syria.


	In parallel, we will work with the United Nations and our partners to forge a lasting settlement of the Syrian conflict that includes full representation for all Syrians, including the people of northeast Syria now recovering from the ISIS occupation.

SECRETARY POMPEO: Thank you all. Thank you. (Applause.) Thank you very much. Well, thank you, Fred, for that kind introduction. It reminded me when I was going through my confirmation process they were chasing down all the people I’d known my whole life, and they found one of the young men who played basketball with me at Los Amigos, and his quote was – they asked how good I was. And he said, “Well, he made the most of what he had.” (Laughter.)


	Thanks for the kind introduction and thanks for hosting me here at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation and Library. It’s a very special place and an honor for me to be here.


	I also want to thank my friend Tom for joining me here tonight. He and I have been on multiple missions together, and I am confident we will continue to do so in the days and weeks and years ahead.


	And it’s great to see Governor Wilson here. I voted for you a couple times a long time ago. (Laughter.)


	And I know we have many members of the Iranian American community with us this evening. This is just a fraction of the quarter million Iranian Americans in Southern California alone. We have many Iranian American guests from all across the United States here as well. Thank you. I look forward to hearing from you this evening, learning more about the situation in Iran as you see it, and understanding what your loved ones and friends are going through living in that place.


	And I recognize the Iranian diaspora is diverse. There are many faith backgrounds and many different walks of life, and that’s a good thing, and not all Iranian Americans see things the same way. But I think everyone can agree that the regime in Iran has been a nightmare for the Iranian people, and it is important that your unity on that point is not diminished by differences elsewhere.


	To our Iranian American and – to our Iranian American friends, tonight I want to tell you that the Trump administration dreams the same dreams for the people of Iran as you do, and through our labors and God’s providence that day will come true. (Applause.)


	Next year will mark the 40th anniversary of the Islamic Revolution in Iran. As I’ll spell out more in a moment, the 40 years of fruit from the revolution has been bitter. Forty years of kleptocracy. Forty years of the people’s wealth squandered on supporting terrorism. Forty years of ordinary Iranians thrown in jail for peaceful expression of their rights. Why has the regime conducted itself in such an abhorrent way over the past 40 years and subjected its people to these conditions? It’s an important question.


	The answer is at root in the revolutionary nature of the regime itself. (Applause.)


	The ideologues who forcibly came to power in 1979 and remain in power today are driven by a desire to conform all of Iranian society to the tenets of the Islamic Revolution. The regime is also committed to spreading the revolution to other countries, by force if necessary. The total fulfillment of the revolution at home and abroad is the regime’s ultimate goal. It drives their behavior. Thus, the regime has spent four decades mobilizing all elements of the Iranian economy, foreign policy, and political life in service of that objective. To the regime, prosperity, security, and freedom for the Iranian people are acceptable casualties in the march to fulfill the revolution.


	Economically, we see how the regime’s decision to prioritize an ideological agenda over the welfare of the Iranian people has put Iran into a long-term economic tailspin. During the time of the nuclear deal, Iran’s increased oil revenues could have gone to improving the lives of the Iranian people. Instead they went to terrorists, dictators, and proxy militias. Today, thanks to regime subsidies, the average Hizballah combatant makes two to three times what an Iranian firefighter makes on the streets of Iran. Regime mismanagement has led to the rial plummeting in value. A third of Iranian youth are unemployed, and a third of Iranians now live below the poverty line.


	The bitter irony of the economic situation in Iran is that the regime uses this same time to line its own pockets while its people cry out for jobs and reform and for opportunity. The Iranian economy is going great – but only if you’re a politically-connected member of the elite. Two years ago, Iranians rightfully erupted in anger when leaked paystubs showed massive amounts of money inexplicably flowing into the bank accounts of senior government officials.


	And there are many more examples of the widespread corruption.


	Take Sadeq Larijani, the head of Iran’s judiciary. He is worth at least $300 million dollars. He got this money from embezzling public funds into his own bank account. The Trump administration sanctioned Larijani in January for human rights abuses, because we aren’t afraid to tackle the regime at its highest level. (Applause.) Call me crazy – you won’t be the first – but I’m a little skeptical that a thieving thug under international sanctions is the right man to be Iran’s highest-ranking judicial official. (Laughter and applause.)


	Former IRGC officer and Minister of Interior Sadeq Mahsouli is nicknamed “the Billionaire General.” He went from being a poor IRGC officer at the end of the Iran-Iraq war to being worth billions of dollars. How’d that happen? He somehow had a knack for winning lucrative construction and oil trading contracts from businesses associated with the IRGC. Being an old college buddy of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad just might have had something to do with it as well. (Laughter.)


	The ayatollahs are in on the act, too. Judging by their vast wealth, they seem more concerned with riches than religion. These hypocritical holy men have devised all kinds of crooked schemes to become some of the wealthiest men on Earth while their people suffer.


	Grand Ayatollah Makaram Shirazi is known as the “Sultan of Sugar” for his illicit trading of sugar, which has generated over $100 million for him. He has pressured the Iranian Government to lower subsidies to domestic sugar producers while he floods the market with his own more expensive imported sugar. This type of activity puts ordinary Iranians out of work.


	Another ayatollah, one of Tehran’s Friday prayer leaders for the last 30 years, had the government transfer several lucrative mines to his foundation. He too is now worth millions of dollars.


	And not many people know this, but the Ayatollah Khamenei has his own personal, off-the-books hedge fund called the Setad, worth $95 billion, with a B. That wealth is untaxed, it is ill-gotten, and it is used as a slush fund for the IRGC. The ayatollah fills his coffers by devouring whatever he wants. In 2013 the Setad’s agents banished an 82-year-old Baha’i woman from her apartment and confiscated the property after a long campaign of harassment. Seizing land from religious minorities and political rivals is just another day at the office for this juggernaut that has interests in everything from real estate to telecoms to ostrich farming. All of it is done with the blessing of Ayatollah Khamenei.


	This list goes on, but we’ve got places to go tonight. The level of corruption and wealth among Iranian leaders shows that Iran is run by something that resembles the mafia more than a government.


	On foreign policy, the regime’s mission of exporting the revolution has produced a decades-long campaign of ideologically-motivated violence and destabilization abroad. Assad, Lebanese Hizballah, Hamas, Shia militant groups in Iraq, and the Houthis in Yemen feed on billions of regime cash while the Iranian people shout slogans like “Leave Syria, think about us.”


	Our partners in the Middle East are plagued by Iranian cyberattacks and threatening behavior in the waters of the Persian Gulf. The regime and its allies in terror have left a trail of dissident blood across Europe and the Middle East.


	Indeed, our European allies are not immune to the threat of regime-backed terrorism.


	Just earlier this month, an Iranian “diplomat” based in Vienna was arrested and charged with supplying explosives for a terrorist bomb scheduled to bomb a political rally in France. This tells you everything you need to know about the regime: At the same time they’re trying to convince Europe to stay in the nuclear deal, they’re covertly plotting terrorist attacks in the heart of Europe.


	And because fighting the United States and destroying Israel is at the core of the regime’s ideology, it has committed and supported many acts of violence and terrorism against both countries and our citizens. As just one example, well over a thousand American service members have been killed and wounded in Iraq from Iranian-made IEDs.


	Today, multiple Americans are detained and missing inside of Iran. Baquer Namazi, Siamak Namazi, Xiyue Wang are unjustly held by the regime to this day, and Bob Levinson has been missing in Iran for over 11 years. There are others, too. And we in the Trump administration are working diligently to bring each of those Americans home from having been wrongfully detained for far too long. (Applause.)

SECRETARY POMPEO: Thank you.


AUDIENCE MEMBER: (Shouting off-mike.)


SECRETARY POMPEO: If there were – if there were only so much freedom of expression in Iran. (Cheers and applause.)


	You know, despite the regime’s clear record of aggression, America and other countries have spent years straining to identify a political moderate. It’s like an Iranian unicorn. (Laughter.) The regime’s revolutionary goals and willingness to commit violent acts haven’t produced anyone to lead Iran that can be remotely called a moderate or a statesman.


	Some believe that President Rouhani and Foreign Minister Zarif fit that bill. The truth is they are merely polished front men for the ayatollahs’ international con artistry. Their nuclear deal didn’t make them moderates; it made them wolves in sheep’s clothing. Governments around the world worry that confronting the Islamic Republic harms the cause of moderates, but these so-called moderates within the regime are still violent Islamic revolutionaries with an anti-America, anti-West agenda. You only have to take their own words for it. And for that matter, the evidence reveals that their agenda is a anti-Iran agenda as well.


	The regime’s absolute adherence to the Islamic Revolution mean it cannot endure any ideas in the Iranian society that would contradict or undermine it – unlike we just did here this evening. It’s why the regime has for decades heartlessly repressed its own people’s human rights, dignity, and fundamental freedoms.


	It’s why the Iranian police detained a teenage Iranian gymnast for posting an Instagram video of herself dancing.


	It’s why the regime arrests hundreds of Ahwazis, members of Iran’s minority Arab community, when they speak out to demand respect for their language and for their basic beliefs. The government’s morality police beat women in the streets and arrest those who do not wish to wear the hijab.


	On “White Wednesday” activist recently – one activist was recently sentenced to 20 years in prison for protesting compulsory hijab wearing.


	The desire to uphold the Islamic Revolution has especially resulted in gross suppression of the freedom of religion in Iran, often to barbaric ends.


	Last month, a simple man, a bus driver, a father of two children, and a member of the Iranian Gonabadi Sufi Dervish Community, was convicted and sentenced to death. His sentence came on questionable grounds following violent clashes between security forces and the Dervishes. He was reportedly denied access to a lawyer before, during – before and during his grossly unfair trial. This man, Mr. Salas – and his supporters – maintains his innocence throughout, reportedly stating he had been tortured into a forced confession. Sadly, on June 18th, the regime hanged Mr. Salas in prison.


	His death was part of a larger crackdown that began in February, when at least 300 Sufis demanding the release of their fellow faith members were unjustly arrested. Right now, hundreds of Sufi Muslims in Iran remain imprisoned on account of their religious beliefs, with reports of several having died at the hands of the regime’s brutal security forces.


	Among those imprisoned is the 91-year-old leader, Dr. Noor Ali Tabandeh, who has been under house arrest for at least the last part of four months – the greatest part of four months. He is in need of immediate medical care.


	The religious intolerance of the regime in Iran does not only extend to Sufi Muslims. The same goes for Christians and Jews and Sunnis and Baha’is and Zoroastrians and members of many other groups inside Iran who live with the fear that their next prayer may be indeed their last.


	What grieves us so badly about the treatment of religious minorities in Iran is that their presence far pre-dates the regime. They are a historic part of the rich fabric of an ancient and vibrant Iranian civilization. That fabric has been torn by intolerant, black-robed enforcers. When other faiths are suppressed, the image of Iran becomes a self-portrait of the ayatollahs and of the IRGC.


	In response to myriad government failures, corruption, and disrespect of rights, since December Iranians have been taking to the streets in the most enduring and forceful protests since 1979. Some shout the slogan, “The people are paupers while the mullahs live like gods.” Others choose to shut down the Grand Bazaar in Tehran. The specific grievances do differ, but all those voicing dissatisfaction share one thing: They have been ill-treated by a revolutionary regime. Iranians want to be governed with dignity, accountability, and respect. (Applause.)


	The regime – this is important. The regime’s brutal response to these peaceful protests reflects the intolerance that its revolutionary worldview has produced. Last January, the regime welcomed in the new year with the arrests of up to 5,000 of its own people. They were peacefully calling for a better life. Hundreds reportedly remain behind bars, and several are dead at the hands of their own government. The leaders cynically call it suicide.


	Overall, it is clear the regime’s ideology has led many Iranians to be angry they cannot call their homeland a “normal” country.


	They know that a constitution that enshrines the export of Islamic revolution and the destruction of its neighbors and the restriction of citizenship is not normal.


	Ordinary Iranians know that their government’s torture of its own people is not normal.


	Earning multiple rounds of sanctions by the UN Security Council is not normal.


	Inciting chants of “Death to America” and “Death to Israel” is not normal.


	Being the number one state sponsor of terror is similarly abnormal.


	Sometimes it seems the world has become desensitized to the regime’s authoritarianism at home and its campaigns of violence abroad, but the proud Iranian people are not staying silent about their government’s many abuses.


	And the United States under President Trump will not stay silent either. (Applause.)


	In light of these protests and 40 years of regime tyranny, I have a message for the people of Iran: The United States hears you; the United States supports you; the United States is with you.


	When the United States sees the shoots of liberty pushing up through rocky soil we pledge our solidarity, because we too took a hard first step towards becoming a free country a few years back.


	Right now, the United States is undertaking a diplomatic and financial pressure campaign to cut off the funds that the regime uses to enrich itself and support death and destruction. (Applause.) We have an obligation to put maximum pressure on the regime’s ability to generate and move money, and we will do so.


	At the center of this campaign is the re-imposition of sanctions on Iran’s banking and energy sectors.


	As we have explained over the last few weeks, our focus is to work with countries importing Iranian crude oil to get imports as close to zero as possible by November 4th. Zero.


	Recently – (applause). Recently, as part of this campaign, we designated the Bahraini Shia militia terrorist organization Saraya al-Ashtar, and with the UAE we have jointly disrupted a currency exchange network that was transferring millions of dollars to the IRGC.


	And there’s more to come. Regime leaders – especially those at the top of the IRGC and the Quds Force like Qasem Soleimani – must be made to feel painful consequences of their bad decision making. (Applause.) We are asking every nation, every nation who is sick and tired of the Islamic Republic’s destructive behavior, to join our pressure campaign. This especially goes for our allies in the Middle East and Europe, people who have themselves been terrorized by violent regime’s activity for decades.


	And you should know that the United States is not afraid to spread our message on the airwaves and online inside of Iran either. (Applause.) For 40 years the Iranian people have heard from their leaders that America is the “Great Satan.” We do not believe they are interested in hearing the fake news any longer. (Laughter and applause.)


	Today, one in four Iranians – 14 million people – watches or listens to U.S. Government broadcasts each week. And it’s more important than ever now to refute the regime’s lies and repeat our deep desire for friendship with the Iranian people. Right now, our U.S. Board – Broadcasting Board of Governors is taking new steps to help Iranians get around internet censorship as well. The BBG is also launching a new 24/7 Farsi-language TV channel. It will span not only television, but radio, digital, and social media format, so that the ordinary Iranians inside of Iran and around the globe can know that America stands with them. (Applause.)


	And finally – and finally, America is unafraid to expose human rights violations and support those who are being silenced.


	We continue to raise our concerns over the Islamic Republic’s dire record of human rights abuses each time we speak at the UN and with our partners who maintain diplomatic relations with that country. We make it clear that the world is watching, and as the regime continues to make its own people the longest-suffering victims, we will not stand silent. (Applause.)


	And now we call on everyone here in the audience and our international partners to help us shine a spotlight on the regime’s abuses and to support the Iranian people.


	The goal of our efforts is to one day see Iranians in Iran enjoying the same quality of life that Iranians in America enjoy. (Cheers and applause.)


	Iranians in America enjoy all the freedoms secured by their government, not trampled by it. They are free to pursue economic opportunities they believe are best for them and their families, and they can be proud of their country and practice their faiths in the way they desire.


	There are a few individuals with us I want to highlight tonight who embody what we hope for the Iranian people.


	Goli Ameri came to the United States as a freshman at Stanford and has founded successful companies and has served at the State Department and at the UN.


	Susan Azizzadeh was forced to leave everything behind and come here in 1979. Today she is the leader of the Iranian American Jewish Federation. (Cheers and applause.)


	Makan Delrahim – I think I saw him – came to America with his family when he was just 10 years old. (Applause.) He is now the Assistant Attorney General at the Department of Justice – quite amazing. (Applause.)


	We hope that the successes of Goli and Susan and Makan and the many others American – Iranian Americans among the diaspora in the United States remind all Iranians of what is possible under a government that respects its people and governs with accountability. Iranians should not have to flee their homeland to find a better life. (Applause.)


	While it is ultimately up to the Iranian people to determine the direction of their country, the United States, in the spirit of our own freedoms, will support the long-ignored voice of the Iranian people. Our hope is that ultimately the regime will make meaningful changes in its behavior both inside of Iran and globally. As President Trump has said, we’re willing to talk with the regime in Iran, but relief from American pressure will come only when we see tangible, demonstrated, and sustained shifts in Tehran’s policies.


	I thought I’d close tonight in a perfectly appropriate way by invoking the words of a man who routinely made the case for freedom and respect far more eloquently than I ever could, President Ronald Reagan. In 1982 – (applause).


	In 1982, President Reagan gave a speech to the British Parliament that became known as the Westminster address. He urged other Western governments to support those around the world trying to break free of tyranny and injustice. His reason why was simple and powerful. He said, “Freedom is not the sole prerogative of a lucky few, but the inalienable right and universal right of every human being.”


	This is why we also call on all governments to end their flirtations with a revolutionary regime and come quickly to the aid of the Iranian people. (Applause.) On that same day in those same remarks, President Reagan said, “Let us ask ourselves: ‘What kind of people do we think we are?’ And let us answer, ‘Free people, worthy of freedom, and determined not only to remain so, but to help others gain their freedom as well.’”


	Today, the United States condemns oppression levied on the Iranian people by those who rule unjustly, and we proudly amplify the voices of those in Iran longing to have those inalienable and universal human rights cease to be ignored and instead to be honored. We do so knowing that many in the streets and marketplaces speak for those who the regime has permanently silenced over the years – who may even have been loved ones who are in the audience tonight.


	It’s America’s hope that the next 40 years of Iran’s history will not be marked by repression and fear – but with freedom and fulfillment – for the Iranian people.


	Thank you. (Applause.)


GOVERNOR WILSON: Well, you’ve answered all the questions.


SECRETARY POMPEO: We’ll take another swing. Thank you.


GOVERNOR WILSON: Well, Mr. Secretary, I had some questions for you, but you actually answered almost all of them quite eloquently.


SECRETARY POMPEO: We’ll see if I can give the same answer when I’m not – got remarks in front of me. (Laughter.)


GOVERNOR WILSON: Well, let me just start with this one. Is it realistic to think that the Iranian people will ever regain control of their country in what we would term the foreseeable future?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Of course. (Applause.) Well, of course. Of course. I always remind those who think it’s not possible or think the time horizon will be measured in centuries not hours, I always remind them that things change. There are disjunctive moments. There are times when things happen that are unexpected, unanticipated. Our revolution would be one of them. I could go on. You all could name them, too.


	We don’t know the right moment. We don’t know the day that the behavior of the Iranian regime will change. But we do know the things that the world is obligated to do so that when the right time comes, when the right moment comes, that opportunity is even more likely to find its fulfillment.


GOVERNOR WILSON: Would you synthesize your excellent speech and really in a few words say what you think the best way to effect that change within the Iranian Government is and how the Trump administration is helping the Iranian people in their struggle to become freed from this current tyrannical administration there?


SECRETARY POMPEO: So President Trump has been absolutely unequivocal on this not only in the message but in the fact that this is a real priority for the administration as well. I think that’s important. One could have a objective, but if one doesn’t rank it sufficiently high attention spans are short and resources limited. The President has put this as something he considers to be incredibly important.


	The mission set for our team is clear. It’s to deny the Iranian leadership the resources, the wealth, the funds, the capacity to continue to foment terrorism around the world and to deny the people inside of Iran the freedoms that they so richly deserve. How’s that in 30 seconds? (Laughter.)


GOVERNOR WILSON: That’s pretty good. (Applause.) There is a perception among some that Iranians, including students and including legitimate visitors, can’t obtain U.S. visas because of a travel ban. Would you clarify what U.S. policy is regarding what we will call Iranian civil society visitors?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Sure, I’d be happy to do that. So President Trump has made clear with respect to a number of countries that weren’t providing us with sufficient information that we had risks of American security that we were going to do our best to work with those countries to develop the information that we needed. Iran continues to deny us the basic data-sharing systems that hundreds of countries – or, excuse me, dozens and dozens of countries have already provided us. We would like Iran to do that.


	We still allow students to come in. There are many students. I’m sure there are students here tonight who are Iranians who are here studying. We welcome that. But this administration does have as one of its primary policies to make sure that we appropriately vet all those who come to the nation so that we can keep our country safe. That’s the plan. That’s the policy. (Applause.)


GOVERNOR WILSON: Well, on perhaps an unduly optimistic note, what could be a basis for reconciliation between the United States and Iran?


SECRETARY POMPEO: So it’s always possible. (Laughter.) And the President has made clear the fact that – I shouldn’t have joked. The President has made clear he would love that, he would welcome that. I’ve now made three trips to Pyongyang, a regime that has treated its citizens in way that also denies them their freedoms.


	The President has said if we can get this change, if we can get the leadership to make a strategic decision about how to ensure its well-being and the well-being of its peoples, that we’re prepared to have a conversation and to discuss how that might proceed. The President has stated at least once, perhaps more than once, that he is prepared to do that with the leadership in Iran, but not until such time as there are demonstrable, tangible, irreversible changes in the Iranian regime that I don’t see happening today. But I live in hope. (Applause.)


GOVERNOR WILSON: And what would be your advice for students – hopefully many in the audience today – who will be interested in being part of that effort and seek a career at the State Department? How can they best prepare and what challenges should they anticipate?


SECRETARY POMPEO: So we welcome all hardworking, talented patriotic folks to come be part of a great diplomatic team in the United States. It’s an incredible honor. I’m now 12 weeks, almost to the day, as the Secretary of State. The team is fantastic. My wisdom for them is no different than the same wisdom I gave my son. If he was here he’d be rolling his eyes about now. (Laughter.)


	Work hard, study, tell the truth every place you go. We have lots of folks who speak different languages who have spent time in other countries who have been able to learn about other cultures. It’s critically important that we get that skill set at the State Department. Those are the kinds of things that young people who want a wonderful, exciting, rewarding, important career working as an American diplomat ought to think about doing as they move their way through college and beyond and we welcome. Go to state.gov. It’s easy to find. We’ve got lots of great places for talented young Americans to come be part of our great team. (Applause.)


GOVERNOR WILSON: Well, Mr. Secretary, you have been quite clear, and it’s, I think, clear to all of us who are privileged to be in this audience and in this house dedicated to the preservation and the enhancement of the Ronald Reagan legacy that you understand it better than perhaps anybody I’ve come across in a long time. (Applause.)


	We, I think, both remember that at a critical time in the history of this country he said, with a smile, “Trust, but verify.” (Laughter.)

SECRETARY POMPEO: Good afternoon, everyone. First I want to commend my good friend Ambassador Haley and her excellent team here at the United Nations. Her leadership in advancing American interest on North Korea and many other issues has been evident here this morning, and she’s got a great team behind her helping. So thank you, Nikki.


	The main reason I came here today was to meet with members of the UN Security Council – South Korea and Japan as well – to convey details of my work on the trip to North Korea earlier this month and the progress that was made there. I also had the opportunity to meet with UN Secretary-General Guterres to discuss the topic and other topics as well.


	The countries of the Security Council are united on the need for final, fully verified denuclearization of North Korea, as agreed to by Chairman Kim. Strict enforcement of sanctions is critical to our achieving this goal.


	Members of the UN Security Council, and by extension all UN member-states, have unanimously agreed to fully enforce sanctions on North Korea, and we expect them to continue to honor those commitments. When sanctions are not enforced, the prospects for the successful denuclearization are diminished. Right now, North Korea is illegally smuggling petroleum products into the country at a level that far exceeds the quotas established by the United Nations. These illegal ship-to-ship transfers are the most prominent means by which this is happening.


	These transfers happened at least 89 times in the first five months of this year and they continue to occur. The United States reminds every UN member-state of its responsibility to stop illegal ship-to-ship transfers, and we urge them to step up their enforcement efforts as well.


	We must also crack down on other forms of sanctions evasion, including the smuggling of coal by sea, smuggling by overland borders, and the presence of North Korean guest workers in certain countries. North Korean cyber thefts and other criminal activities are also generating significant revenues for the regime, and they must be stopped.


	President Trump remains upbeat about the prospects of denuclearization of North Korea. So do I, as progress is happening. It is the Trump administration’s hope that one day the DPRK could be in our midst here at the United Nations – not as a pariah, but as a friend. Imagine UN Security Council meetings in which the DPRK nuclear and missile programs were not the agenda time and time again. We’ll be able to focus our energy on so many urgent problems that face our world.


	I believe this reality is possible, and so does President Trump. But it will take full enforcement of sanctions for us to get there. It will also take Chairman Kim following through on his personal commitments that he made to President Trump in Singapore. The path ahead is not easy; it will take time. But our hopes for a safer world for all of us and a brighter future for North Korea remains our objective, and that hope endures.


	Thank you. Ambassador Haley.


AMBASSADOR HALEY: Thank you so much. And I’m very grateful to my friend, Secretary Pompeo, for coming out and meeting with the Security Council today.


	This is what we know. Eighteen months ago when I came in, our biggest concern was North Korea. Everyone was wondering when that new test was going to happen, everyone was wondering when the new threat would occur, and the entire international community knew something had to happen. It was a herculean task by the Security Council to pass three massive sanctions packages, getting rid of all exports, 90 percent of their trade, 30 percent of their oil, expelling all labor workers and scheduling that down, making sure all joint ventures stopped. All of that combined with the international community coming together and expelling diplomats and stopping communication, and with the President’s tough stance, all of that was really the combination that brought North Korea to the table.


	Now, North Korea and the U.S. have started to have talks. And as those things are happening, we and the Security Council and the international community have to support those talks. And the best way we can support those talks is to not loosen the sanctions. And what we have been seeing is certain countries wanting to do waivers, certain countries saying, “Let’s lift sanctions,” certain countries wanting to do more. And what – I appreciate Secretary Pompeo coming up and what we continue to reiterate is we can’t do one thing until we see North Korea respond to their promise to denuclearize. We have to see some sort of action. And so until that action happens, the Security Council’s going to hold tight, the international community – we ask you to hold tight as we go forward.


	The problem that we are encountering is that some of our friends have decided that they want to go around the rules. You saw that there was violations of the oil ban. We have, as Secretary Pompeo said, seen 89 times where that has happened. We have photographs of proof of ship-to-ship transfers. And our friends, what we decided was let’s come together and let’s make sure that this stops. So the U.S. put yesterday a halt to all additional refined petroleum shipments to North Korea. China and Russia blocked it.


	Now for China and Russia to block it, what are they telling us? Are they telling us that they want to continue supplying this oil? They claim they need more information. We don’t need any more information. The sanctions committee has what it needs. We all know it’s going forward. We put pressure today on China and Russia to abide and be good helpers through this situation and to help us continue with denuclearization.


	And so I think this was a day of very frank talk between the Secretary, the foreign minister of South Korea, our Japanese friends as well, as well as the Security Council to say: If we want to see success, we have to see a response from Chairman Kim, and we have to continue to hold the line until that happens. And so very successful day, again, promising that the Security Council has remained united and continuing to put pressure on our members to not fall through on that process. Thank you.


QUESTION: Mr. Secretary --


MS NAUERT: Three quick – three quick questions. Rich Edson, Fox News.


QUESTION: Thank you. Mr. Secretary, UN Ambassador Haley mentioned that Russia isn’t being all that helpful to sanctions enforcement. The President mentioned after his meeting with President Putin that President Putin was going to help on North Korea. Is Russia reneging on an agreement that it made with the President? And is – what else did the two presidents agree to when they met?


SECRETARY POMPEO: So enforcement of sanctions is a continuing process. There are many places where the Russians have been helpful. Certainly since the very beginning of the time of the UN Security resolutions the Russians have done many things to enforce these sanctions, and we’re deeply appreciative of that. What we need now, though, is we need to continue that. We need to make sure that the world doesn’t begin to see this – this is not an American demand for the North Koreans to denuclearize; it is the world’s demand and we need the world to continue to participate.


	And so where we find issues where any country, whether it’s Russia or another one, not doing their part to enforce it, we’re going to make sure that we provide the information to them so they can all see it and the world can see it, and we’re going to demand that every country in the world do their part.


MS NAUERT: Kylie from CBS News.


QUESTION: Just following up, Mr. Secretary, on a question about Russia, because that’s kind of what everyone in Washington is talking about today. Why is it a good idea for the President to invite Vladimir Putin to the White House? What does the U.S. have to gain from that visit?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Yeah, I’m happy that the two leaders of two very important countries are continuing to meet. If that meeting takes place in Washington, I think it’s all to the good. Those conversations are incredibly important. We have our senior leaders meeting all across the world with people where we have deep disagreements with. It is incredibly valuable to the people of the United States of America that President Putin and President Trump continue to engage in dialogue to resolve the difficult issues that our countries face between each other. I think this makes enormous sense, and I’m very hopeful that that meeting will take place this fall.


MS NAUERT: And final question, Michelle from Reuters.


QUESTION: Thank you. Mr. Secretary, what concrete steps do you need to see North Korea take now to show that they are committed to denuclearization? And on Russia, the Russian defense ministry said this morning that they’ve sent proposals to Washington about the return of millions of Syrian refugees. They said it’s based on an agreement that was reached by President Putin and President Trump. Have you seen those proposals, and what is this agreement that they’ve reached?


SECRETARY POMPEO: So I’ll take the second one first. So lots of discussion taking place. There was a discussion between President Trump and President Putin about the resolution in Syria and how we might get the refugees back. The President shared with me the conversations that they’d had. It is important to the world that at the right time, through a voluntary mechanism, these refugees are able to return to their home country. It’s what we’ve all been working on. It’s what the UN has been working on with Staffan de Mistura working on that very same problem set. And President Putin and President Trump did discuss that. There’s lots of work to do to figure out how to implement that, but the United States certainly wants to be part of help achieving that resolution in Syria, make no mistake about it.


	Your first question was about what we need to see. It’s really pretty straightforward, right? And it’s not my – it’s not my description of what needs to take place. Chairman Kim made a promise. Chairman Kim told not only President Trump, but President Moon that he was prepared to denuclearize. The scope and scale of that is agreed to. The North Koreans understand what that means. There’s no mistake about what the scope of denuclearization looks like.


	So what do we need to see? We need to see Chairman Kim do what he promised the world he would do. It’s not very fancy, but it’s the truth.


MS NAUERT: All right. Thank you. Thank you.


QUESTION: One more – one more question, Mr. Secretary?


MS NAUERT: Thank you, everyone.

QUESTION: Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, welcome to the ABC. Thank you for your time.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Great. It’s good to be with you this morning, Andrew.


QUESTION: Yes. You are holding a ministerial summit, and I want to ask you about some of the challenges to religious freedom that your own department has identified. Your administration has reached out to North Korea. Your own department has identified shocking violations of religious freedom there. Will any further rapprochement with North Korea depend on North Korea opening up to religious freedom and human rights?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Well, thanks for the question. We have a first-ever religious freedom ministerial here at the State Department. We’re going to have over 80 delegations from all across the world, 40 at the foreign minister level. Religious freedom is something that’s very important to me personally; it’s very important to President Trump. And the State Department is going to lead the world in opening up religious freedom to every citizen. That would certainly include places like North Korea. Well, that will be a real priority for our administration as well. We believe every human being ought to have the right to worship in the way that they prefer, or to choose not to if that’s their preference as well. All faiths.


QUESTION: Yeah. Mr. Secretary, you have met Kim Jong-un. Have you raised directly with him the questions of religious freedom in his country?


SECRETARY POMPEO: I’ve not talked about the details of my conversation with Chairman Kim. The world should know, and your listeners should know, that in every place I go, whether they’re countries with strong values of religious freedom or those that do not, we place this as a real priority and we raise this issue in countries that are difficult and challenging every time we confront them. We believe that religious freedom for every citizen of the world is something that’s very important.


QUESTION: The religious – the Commission on Religious Freedom report that your department publishes has also accused Russia uniquely of repressing religious rights through the invasion of another country – that’s Crimea. It says Russia should be criticized in multilateral settings. Can the world rely on President Trump to publicly raise religious repression in Russia with President Putin in future?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Look, there are a lot of issues that we have with Russia, and the President just returned from Helsinki, where they discussed a broad range of issues and, frankly, broke some ground across a broad range of them. And our mission, Andrew, with this ministerial meeting is to re-force this set of issues. We’re going to have countries here that aren’t perfect, that are on the cusp of religious freedom. And we want to push them all in the right direction. And that’s our mission statement. We’re welcoming Christians and Muslims and Jews and people of diverse faiths from all across the world to become part of this. We believe this is a central pillar of American foreign policy, to have religious freedom at the front. We bring up these issues privately, and we bring them up publicly.


QUESTION: Is Russia going to be at the ministerial meeting?


SECRETARY POMPEO: I haven’t seen the full list. We’ve invited countries from all around the world.


QUESTION: Another area which is difficult for the United States is the question of Saudi Arabia. Ever since this religious freedom report has existed, Saudi Arabia has always gotten among the worst results. Why does the U.S. continue, however, to give Saudi Arabia a waiver or an exemption from sanctions even though the report recommends it?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Andrew, you have to remember the purpose of the gathering here for the next couple days. The mission is very clear. It’s to take each country and help make the case for them why it’s in the best interest of their citizenry and their country to grant rights of religious freedom. Not every country is in the same place. We recognize that; we are eyes-wide-open. But make no mistake about it, unlike previous administrations, we have raised this to every one of our foreign partners and friends, and they know it’s a priority for the United States and for this administration. We believe deeply in this and we’re working in every one of those countries to improve religious freedom for their citizens.


QUESTION: But Mr. Secretary, you yourself are a very sincere Evangelical Christian. You know that in Saudi Arabia, you would not be permitted to worship in your faith. Why does the United States continue this strategic partnership with a country that is so repressive against other religions?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Andrew, look, thanks for the question. I’ve got to run off now. But make no mistake about it, religious freedom is not the only issue that America faces with any one of our partners. It won’t be the only and sole focus. Our relationships are broad. They’re diverse; they cover lots of various issues. And we are acting to make sure that our relationships are in America’s best interest, and religious freedom is a central part of each one of those.


	Thanks, Andrew, for your time this morning.


QUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Secretary. Thank you.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Thank you. So long.

QUESTION: Okay. Mr. Secretary, thanks for doing this. We really appreciate it.


SECRETARY POMPEO: It is a blessing to be with you. Thank you.


QUESTION: Let me ask you – the ministerial conference coming up, the message you want to send on religious freedom. Explain why this event is so important.


SECRETARY POMPEO: So this is a big deal, the first time the State Department has ever hosted such a gathering. We’ll have folks from over 80 countries, 40-plus foreign ministers, all kinds of religious groups and NGOs all coming together on a common theme, which is that the advancement of religious freedom matters to every individual in every country. The human dignity, human rights attached to religious freedom, I feel personally and I know President Trump does as well.


	So we want this administration to make religious freedom a true priority for the United States State Department in every interaction we have with our foreign partners. Not every country will achieve the level of religious freedom that we have here in the United States. We think we can advance it all across the world by bringing together folks from all faiths and frankly those who have no faith, but their capacity to practice religion in the way that they choose is important for the world.


QUESTION: A victory. What is a victory coming out of this? In other words, what are some tangible results that you hope will eventually take seed, take root, if you will?


SECRETARY POMPEO: So we have a number of initiatives that we’ll announce at the ministerial, some things that are concrete – not just talk, but real action. But second, we believe just the fact that we’ll get all these people together in a single room – we don’t believe this has happened before under the auspices of the United States Government. We know it has not. And their presence, the capacity to get to know each other and work together and understand that we know many countries struggle to give religious freedom to their citizens – they’ll see how other countries have overcome those challenges, how they have moved towards a more religiously tolerant society. We think those will demonstrate real, tangible, positive results in the weeks and months to follow this three-day gathering here at the State Department.


QUESTION: Explain a little bit about why this is personal for you. Because you – your faith I know is very, very important to you. You’ve talked about this in public before. So why – this seems – there’s a public policy aspect, but it’s also personal. Tell me a little bit about that.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Look, it’s very consistent with what the Trump administration is trying to achieve with respect to religious freedom, but it also fits with my worldview. I am an Evangelical Christian. I know that not everyone shares that faith, but it’s important. It’s important not only to Christians, but people of all faiths have the capacity to worship in the way that they desire, that they do so without fear of retribution from their government or the risk that they’ll be punished or not have the ability to raise themselves and their families in the faith the way that they want to. It is incredibly important that all faiths have the opportunity – that every individual have the opportunity to practice faith in the way they want. It’s central to my understanding of my religion; it’s central to understanding my role as the Secretary of State as well.


QUESTION: Pastor Brunson real quick, since it obviously ties in. What is your message to President Erdogan and Turkey on this specifically? This has been ongoing to the point of – many folks say – ridiculousness.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Time for Pastor Brunson to return home and to be free. We have worked diligently. The President personally has worked diligently on this issue. This is an example where a higher degree of religious freedom around the world would create less risk not only for the citizens of their own country but for Americans as they travel abroad. Pastor Brunson’s case is very much a focus of the team that I lead here at the State Department, and we’re optimistic that in the days and weeks ahead we’ll get a good outcome for Pastor Brunson, his family, and frankly for many of those that are held in places around the world.


QUESTION: While I have you here, obviously, as Secretary of State, I’ve got to ask you about what’s been going on with Vladimir Putin and Russia. So I just want to get that out. There has been talk at least about Putin wanting these U.S., American citizens interrogated somehow as part of the deal for election meddling and all of that, especially Mike McCaul, the former U.S. ambassador. And that’s why I’m asking you specifically – the former U.S. ambassador for Russia. Is that a nonstarter that American citizens like Mike McCaul can be interrogated by the Russians? It’s getting a lot of pushback.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Yeah, that’s not going to happen. There’s been a lot of heat and relatively little light in the past few days about the President’s visit to Helsinki. He went there with the objective to create an opportunity for leaders of these two powers that own enormous nuclear capacity to have a channel to communicate. There were places they found overlap. We’re going to work on counterterrorism together. We’re hopeful that on some of these grand arms control issues that are very important to the world that there may well be a path forward. But make no mistake; President Trump understands that Russia doesn’t share our interests in every place, and so he was very clear with Vladimir Putin about that.


	With respect to the particular question, the administration is not going to send or force Americans to travel to Russia to be interrogated by Vladimir Putin and his team.


QUESTION: Fair enough. One last question as it relates to Russia. A little bit about what happens now exactly in terms of a lot of folks believe that, in essence, Russia is still spying on the United States. You’re a former CIA guy and now Secretary of State. What’s the answer to that?


SECRETARY POMPEO: There is a long history, decades of history, of Russia’s efforts to undermine Western democracy – the Soviet Union for decades, now Russia for the last few. I don’t expect that will stop. It is this administration’s mission to raise the costs for Russian activity of that kind to attempt to deter them. We’re eyes wide open about Russia’s efforts to undermine Western democracy. We’re going to do our level best to stop them. And when we don’t stop them, we will call them out for it and make sure they understand that that type of behavior is unacceptable. This administration has been incredibly tough on Russia. We’re proud of that, and I’m confident we’ll have to continue to do so as there is still Russian behavior that is inconsistent with a good relationship between our two countries.


QUESTION: Do you think the media and liberals are a little bit out of control on the treason stuff? I mean, they’ve been just hammering this President on open treason. What has been your view of that?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Yeah, it’s silly. I actually looked back at some of the senators’ statements when Obama was – the president was Barack Obama. They were talking about the need for important and good relationship between somehow – somehow they have either changed their mind, or they’ve become pure political hacks. I suspect it’s the latter and not the former.


QUESTION: And while I have you, last question on North Korea human rights. Do you trust Kim Jong-un? You’ve met him, obviously. What’s your sense of that? And how much of human rights and that discussion, religious freedom, ever come up in some of these discussions at all?


SECRETARY POMPEO: So I’m avoiding talking about the conversations I’ve had with the North Koreans as we’re in active negotiations with them, but I want your viewers to know that the United States rarely has an encounter with a country where we don’t raise human rights concerns where they exist. We know the history there in North Korea. We know the history of many countries with which we deal.


	We have a broad range of issues with these nations, so there are times that we can’t make that the only issue upon which we focus. But your viewers should understand that religious freedom and human rights are something that the State Department puts at the center of our discussions with those countries that aren’t living up to what the appropriate standard for those types of behaviors ought to be.


QUESTION: Good luck with the ministerial.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Thank you very much.

SECRETARY POMPEO: Good morning, sir. It’s Mike speaking.


QUESTION: Good morning, Secretary Pompeo. It’s a pleasure to speak to you here and we thank you for taking the time to speak with us.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Oh my goodness, it’s an honor. I’m truly thrilled to be on the line with you.


QUESTION: Thank you. Mr. Secretary, you’re set to host the U.S.’s first summit on religious freedom with your counterparts from around the world. What do you hope to achieve with this meeting?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Well, look, it’s truly a remarkable thing. The State Department, under President Trump, has made religious freedom a true priority for this administration, and so we’re bringing together, this gathering, over 80 delegations. Forty-plus will be my counterparts, foreign ministers from around the world, the largest number ever gathered here at the State Department.


	And our mission is really straightforward and important. It is to spread the word of the importance of religious freedom for every individual around the world. The – we want to press for that. There are countries that share America’s understanding of that, there are those who don’t, and we want to move each of them in the right direction towards increasing – increasing religious freedom. People of all faiths should have the right to worship as they please, or if they choose not to, they should be permitted to do that as well.


QUESTION: And what role do you see Pope Francis and the Catholic Church playing when it comes to promoting religious freedom?


SECRETARY POMPEO: We think they can play a central role. We think it’s incredibly important that not only governments – as in the State Department and the United States – but religious leaders too understand that they need to press for religious freedom for their particular faith and their beliefs, but that they should also play a role in ensuring that there’s religious freedom for those that share other faiths than the one. So we think the Catholic Church can play an important role in the mission that we’re attempting to achieve through gathering these folks in Washington in the days ahead.


QUESTION: And one last question: What relationship do you see between religious freedom, human rights, and economic interests?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Great question. I think they’re all deeply connected. Trump administration and I both agree that religious freedom has enormous benefits for countries. When individuals are permitted to act and behave freely with respect to their faith, they have the capacity for greatness. And so we see a deep connection between religious freedom as a fundamental human right, and the economic benefits that flow to countries that have this religious freedom. Investors prefer countries that have broad religious freedom. Commercial actors see places with religious freedom as places more open and with less risk. We think that religious freedom and human rights and economic success are deeply connected, deeply tied, and we think it benefits American foreign policy to reinforce this.


QUESTION: Okay, Mr. Secretary, I think that’s all we – the questions we have. So thank you very much again for talking with us.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Devin, great. Thank you so much. Have a wonderful day.

QUESTION: Secretary Pompeo, in fact, joins me. Good morning, Mr. Secretary. Good to have you back.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Hugh, it’s good to be with you. It’s been too long.


QUESTION: Well, I want to talk about religious liberty with you, but a first question. You’re just back from Korea, Vietnam, the United Arab Emirates, Brussels, and of course Russia. Last time we talked you stressed that we know everything about everyone who attacks us. And I just want to make sure, for deterrence purposes, is that the case? Are we aware with certainty of the origin of cyber attacks, because it’s so essential to deterrence that we do know that?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Hugh, it’s not always the case every day that we do. But with great frequency, we can do attribution in a way that gives U.S. policymakers an enormous advantage in understanding the threat.


QUESTION: David Sanger has a new book out stressing why we need to be able to pinpoint people and speak about it, because otherwise the whole world will attack us with impunity. Did you take the message to friend and foe that we are watching and we have the tools?


SECRETARY POMPEO: They do know, Hugh. But David’s comments are a little bit naive to be honest with you. It’s the case that we can’t always publicly do what David described. It would be foolish for America to consistently announce everything we know. It would betray how we came to know it; it would share with them information that we don’t want them to have about our capabilities and our skillsets. And so, make no mistake about it, we are very clear with our adversaries, when it’s in our best interest, to share with them what we’re doing.


QUESTION: Now after a major week of events – and I mean, you went through a week that culminated in the Helsinki controversy – then Andrew Brunson does not get released. How hard is it to refocus a department that is convulsed by stories on the ministerial next week and on the individuals like Pastor Brunson? Can you get everyone to get back on the page of focusing on religious liberty next week?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Hugh, thanks for the question. We’ve got a religious freedom ministerial that is going to have 80-plus delegations. It’s historic. It’s the first time the State Department has taken on this mission. We believe religious freedom is central to the world and to, frankly, America’s place in the world. We make it a real priority. Pastor Brunson in particular has been a priority of mine since even before I had this current role. The entire administration is focused on getting his return.


	But one of the reasons we’re conducting the ministerial, Hugh, is because not every country shares our same understanding of religious freedom, and our effort in holding this ministerial here, where we have 40-plus foreign minister level visitors coming to attend, is to move each country in the direction where increased religious freedom around the world can thrive.


QUESTION: Now, Secretary Pompeo, for the benefit of the Steelers fans and others, a ministerial is a term they may not be familiar with. You just alluded to what it means. It means people like the Secretary of State of the United States and your counterpart in the United Kingdom and across the world coming to Washington. So what’s on that agenda?


SECRETARY POMPEO: It’s a broad agenda. We’re going to talk about how religious freedom fits into a democratic society, how it makes sense for each country, how it can improve economies in the world by having this religious freedom, by allowing all persons of every faith – or those who have no faith – to have the freedom to worship or choose not to in the way that they prefer. We believe that improving respect for religious freedom requires more than just talk, and so we’re bringing people together. We’ll announce several new initiatives over the course of the two days of the summit. And we’re very much looking forward to it. We’re hosting a huge gathering here at the State Department that I think will advance the cause of religious freedom around the world in a way that America has not done for too long.


QUESTION: Every year, we put out a list of Countries of Particular Concern, CPCs. At the top of that list every year is Iran, which may be the most anti-Semitic and the most repressive of other religion countries in the world. I don’t imagine Iran is sending anyone to this conference. But what can we do to encourage an extremist, fanatical regime like Iran to leave their indigenous other religions alone?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Iran is a huge challenge. They would be a perfect exemplar for the absence of religious freedom inside of a country. There are others too. With respect to Iran, a key component of this is exactly what we’re doing at this gathering. We’re talking about it; we’re raising it. We’re raising the awareness. You referenced the report that the State Department puts out. It’s just a piece of paper; it’s just words, for sure. But calling it out and trying to articulate the rationale for why it matters and those that are behaving badly, whether it’s by anti-Semitism or persecuting Christians, these are incredibly important concerns to the United States and to President Trump. And our mission in holding this gathering is to get the world to unite behind this fundamental concept of religious freedom for every individual.


QUESTION: Now Secretary Pompeo, last week the forces of Daniel Ortega opened fire on a Catholic church. They actually kept up a gun battle aimed at a Catholic church all night long. What do we do in response to that?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Nicaragua has got enormous challenges today. The Ortega regime, including his wife, are behaving – it’s not just about the attack on the church. Their activities – the violence level has been raised. We are working to bring all of the elements of U.S. power to bear there. The State Department is at the front of trying to convince Ortega that it’s time for a democratic process to begin and a solution to be achieved there and that violence is not a mechanism that’s going to result in success for either he, his family, or the elites around him.


QUESTION: Well, let me close, Mr. Secretary, by going back to the Helsinki summit. Just a factual question: Were you consulted by the Department of Justice before the indictments were filed?


SECRETARY POMPEO: I can’t talk about that, Hugh.


QUESTION: And while – and theoretically, would it be useful for the Department of State to be consulted before such matters as important as that are conducted, on a theoretical basis?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Yes, Hugh. It is common practice that when the Department of Justice is going to take action that has diplomatic implications or foreign policy implications that we would be notified of those actions.


QUESTION: And then back to Pastor Brunson. Do we have any reason to hope, in the week ahead, that he gets out, Secretary Pompeo?


SECRETARY POMPEO: I – as a man of faith, Hugh, I am always of the belief that good things will happen. And you should know that the United States Government is working diligently to ensure the release of Pastor Brunson. And then there are others being held in Turkey too that we’re working hard on.


QUESTION: Secretary Pompeo, thank you for joining me. And good luck with the ministerial next week. It’s vitally important that people pay attention to it. And I appreciate your taking the time this morning.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Thank you, Hugh. It’s wonderful to be back with you. So long.

QUESTION: Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, welcome to News Nightly. Thank you for joining us.


SECRETARY POMPEO: It’s wonderful to be with you.


QUESTION: This has been quite a week. President Putin and President Trump gave a press conference that was condemned by the left and right. Was that press conference criticism warranted?


SECRETARY POMPEO: There’s been a lot of heat and very little light following that press conference. I was there. I watched the President’s interaction with President Putin after their one-on-one meeting. The President had the objective of taking two countries that’d been on a bad path and trying to redirect that. There’s no illusion about the challenges that Russia presents to the United States. But in places like counterterrorism and – these are two nuclear-armed nations, if we can reduce the risk from those nuclear weapons. The President was aiming towards creating a channel for communication and dialogue, and he achieved that.


QUESTION: Did you advise him to retract his statements?


SECRETARY POMPEO: I don’t talk about the things I give the President advice on. But I’m always very candid about what it is I think we need to do to make sure to keep America safe. And the President has always been gracious in allowing me to say my piece.


QUESTION: Will we see transcripts from either the North Korea meeting or the Russia meeting?


SECRETARY POMPEO: I’d be very surprised if we see transcripts from either. That would be ahistorical. There are conversations that I’ve had with the North Koreans, conversations that government officials have all across the USG that aren’t appropriate for public release.


QUESTION: Let’s move on to religious freedom. You have convened a ministerial to talk about religious freedom all around the world. Let’s start with Russia. Russia, especially when it comes to Jehovah’s Witnesses, is very bad at allowing people to practice their faith. Will religious freedom be on the table when negotiating with Russia?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Well, thanks for mentioning the ministerial that’s going to (inaudible). It’s truly historic. It’s the first time the State Department has led such a discussion. We’ll have over 80 delegations from countries around the world, many, many religious organizations, NGOs. It should be a great gathering where we will make the point that religious freedom is a human right and that every individual ought to have their right to practice their particular religion, or if they have no faith, to not be punished for that either.


QUESTION: Will there be sanctions if they do not come to the table with religious freedom changes?


SECRETARY POMPEO: So with Russia in particular, we have a very complex set of relationships. There are many things that are on the table. I think your viewers ought to know that the State Department takes this issue of religious freedom very seriously. In conversations with countries that don’t live up to the standards of religious freedom that they ought to have, we raise that issue, sometimes privately if we think that’s the most effective way to achieve the change that we’re looking for, and sometimes publicly if we think that will accomplish our goal.


QUESTION: When you announced this ministerial, you said that you would bring like-minded countries together. People made a big deal about that. Will Russia be at the table? Will Syria? Will Iran?


SECRETARY POMPEO: There’s lots of folks coming. I haven’t seen the final RSVP tally. And I’m sure there’ll be countries here that we have deep disagreements with. But the – when I said like-minded, I meant those countries that are prepared to begin their walk towards the religious freedom that we have enshrined in our Constitution and that our nation so values and cherishes.


QUESTION: American pastor Andrew Brunson is imprisoned in Turkey on false charges of terrorism and espionage. He’s awaiting his fourth hearing.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Yeah, we need to get him out. He needs to come home.


QUESTION: Well, you brought the North Korea hostages home. Why can’t we bring Brunson home?


SECRETARY POMPEO: We’re working it. It’s a priority. We’re in conversations every day in the State Department with elements of the Turkish Government. We are – we remain hopeful and prayerful that Pastor Brunson will be able to return home before too terribly long.


QUESTION: I visited the Nineveh Plains in Iraq. We’ve seen the destruction in a place where the U.S. declared genocide. I walked into bombed-out churches. People have nowhere to live. Total towns are decimated. The U.S. is providing aid to that area, to both Christians and others. How does the U.S. convince governments, not just in the Middle East, to respect religious freedom for all citizens, including Saudi Arabia, where you’re not allowed to practice another religion?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Yes, ma’am. The Trump administration has been incredibly strong in promoting religious freedom. It is the case that there are many countries – indeed countries that we often work alongside, who are allies in other places – we work to demonstrate to them that religious tolerance and freedom is good for them. It’s good for their country; it’s good for their government. It’ll bring investors; it’ll make their people more productive. We think these are all – this fundamental human right, this concept that every individual ought to have the right to practice their own faith, we think makes their countries stronger too. And we work to make that case both by speaking to them about it and, in America, demonstrating that in the way that we act and operate and the way that when U.S. Government officials are out and about we respect each of their capacity to worship in the way that they desire.


QUESTION: There are issues of religious freedom here in the U.S. How can you take the moral high ground unless those are addressed?


SECRETARY POMPEO: My faith teaches me that imperfection is all around us, and when it comes to government that’s certainly the case as well. I think the United States stands as an enormous beacon of religious freedom. I’m confident that we can always do better. We ought to do that here as well. But we stand strong here in the United States for religious tolerance and freedom, and I think that’s an important demonstration to the world of how valuable that fundamental human right can be to a strong and successful nation.


QUESTION: U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, thank you for joining me.

QUESTION: Secretary Pompeo, thank you very much for talking to Voice of America.


SECRETARY POMPEO: It’s great to be with you on Voice of America. Thank you. Thank you for having me on today.


QUESTION: On the ethnic cleansing against the Rohingya Muslims, with the Buddhists being the majority in Myanmar, the purge against Rohingya is sometimes characterized by some as religious cleansing. At the same time, killing is the worst crime for Buddhism and for many religion. Would you go further to identify the Rohingya crisis as the religious cleansing?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Well, the State Department made a decision at the end of last year to make the important statement about ethnic cleansing, and we know that there is a religious connection there. It’s incredibly important that we’re careful in the language that we use, and so we’ll continue to review it. But as you well know, the State Department considers religious freedom at the center of its activity. We make that a priority in all of the work that we do, and in places in Asia, that is absolutely no exception.


QUESTION: Would you consider a comprehensive arms embargo and more targeted financial sanctions against tough Burmese military leaders for their involvement of the Rohingya purge?


SECRETARY POMPEO: I don’t want to get out ahead of the President on this, but you should know we take these issues incredibly seriously and your viewers should know that as well. There are many things that are under consideration by this administration. We want to see the course changing; we want to see the directional change here. We have not seen that yet, and so there are many things that are being considered by the United States Government to ensure that everyone understands that their behavior is not acceptable.


QUESTION: In China, the State Department’s International Religious Freedom Report documented the repression against the Uighur Muslims and Tibetan Buddhists. First of all, would you – how would you respond to the assertion from the Chinese Government that some of the groups are separatist? And secondly, would you consider a travel ban or working with the Treasury Department to freeze the U.S. assets of those Chinese officials who are involved in such repression?


SECRETARY POMPEO: So the State Department has made clear that with respect to this issue, we think they’re on the wrong side of religious freedom, that they’re a country of concern connected to that. We understand that religious freedom is at risk in many places in the world, and yet the United States has complex, broad relationships with many countries, including China, across economic and military and political sets of issues.


	Your viewers should know the United States also puts religious freedom, this fundamental human right, at the very center of our discussions with every country with whom we interact.


QUESTION: Religious freedom is a universal value, as you mentioned. How would you respond to the Chinese assertion that some of the surveillance program is to prevent a terrorist attack?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Well, I don’t want to comment. Every country does work to make sure that their citizens are safe, but we should never – no country should ever use that effort, the guise of a counterterrorism investigation, to persecute religious freedom. Religious freedom is separate and apart from that. Every human, by nature of their dignity as a human being, deserves the capacity to worship in the way that they want to worship, or if they choose not to – to worship at all, so be it. No one should be punished by their government for their religious beliefs or the religious activities connected to those beliefs.


QUESTION: We – while we are sitting here, critics, including State Department’s own report, said that in eastern Ukraine, Russia-led forces continue to occupy religious buildings of religious minority groups for the use of – for the military facilities. You were at Helsinki. Was that a good meeting, and how has Russia’s activities in eastern Ukraine been discussed?


SECRETARY POMPEO: So I’ve seen those reports about the Russians’ use of religious facilities. That’s never acceptable. It violates all sorts of central premises of how nations ought to be able to use religious facilities to protect your forces, creates real challenges.


	With respect to Helsinki, President Trump made clear to Vladimir Putin that their activities in eastern Ukraine weren’t in Russia’s best interest. This administration’s been incredibly tough. We’ve provided support to the Ukrainian forces there in southeast Ukraine that the previous administration repeatedly refused to do. We think this creates a space for the Ukrainian people to have a successful election come 2019, and we are very, very hopeful that that situation will resolve itself as America has made its continued commitment to support the Ukrainian people’s desires.


QUESTION: The time is running out, so for the last question, you mentioned Russia. So there has been a lot of concern over Russia proposal to question former Ambassador McFaul. Do you have any --


SECRETARY POMPEO: Yeah, let me just stop you. It’s not going to happen. The Russians made a proposal about a number of things during the course of the conversations between President Trump and President Putin. There were suggestions, comments, thoughts by President Putin with respect to that inquiry. President Trump was very clear we’re not going to force Americans to go to Russia to be interrogated by the Russians. There’s been a lot of noise about that; I don’t know why. Just – the American people should rest assured.

QUESTION: Mr. Secretary, thank you for your time today. We’re here to talk about an historic meeting that you’ve gathered next week on persecuted religious minorities around the globe, but first I want to get to some news of the day.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Yes, ma’am.


QUESTION: Let’s talk about Russia. What do you make of the assessment our President appeared weak standing next to President Putin in Helsinki, and even allegations by lawmakers that he must, quote, “have something” on our President for him to be acting this way?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Well, Shannon, thanks for having me on today. I think those allegations are absurd. This administration has been relentless in its efforts to deter Russia from its bad behavior. We inherited a situation where Russia was running all over the United States. These last few days have been, frankly, more heat than light. This administration has been strong in supporting the Ukrainians, strong in making sure that we’re protected against Russian expansion in other parts of the world. We all recognize that that threat is real, and President Trump has been strong in protecting America from Russian aggression.


QUESTION: New York Times is reporting that the President was fully briefed a couple of weeks before the inauguration about meddling, presented compelling evidence about that. Do you worry as a member who has deep roots in the intel community that it appears he continues to equivocate on this issue of whether or not there has been Russian meddling?


SECRETARY POMPEO: I’m in a position to know. I did have the chance to talk to the President about this. Frankly, over the last – goodness – almost year and a half now, the President’s consistently been briefed on this issue. He understands that the Russians have interfered in our elections. He, frankly, understands that’s been going on for an awfully long time. It wasn’t just the 2016 elections. Somehow America seems to forget the history of Russia’s efforts to undermine Western democracy for decades now. It gets confused because there are those who want to make a partisan case out of this with respect to the Mueller investigation. The President understands what Russia did in our elections in 2016, but he has empowered each of us to make sure that it doesn’t happen again in the 2018 or 2020 elections here in the United States as well.


QUESTION: And looking at those things moving forward, the President was asked repeatedly yesterday by a member of the press corps about whether he believes meddling is still ongoing. He responded, “Thank you. No.” The White House says he was saying no to any further questions. Do you believe Russia is still meddling in our elections?


SECRETARY POMPEO: I have great confidence that the Russians will try and undermine Western democracy in 2017, 2018, 2019, and for an awfully long time. It is our responsibility as leaders of the United States Government to do all that we can to deter them from interfering with us, not only in our elections but more broadly as well.


QUESTION: The Russian ambassador to the U.S. is now saying that there were, quote, “important verbal agreements” made in private conversations between our presidents. Can you tell us anything about those?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Well, I’m not sure I’d take the Russian ambassador’s word for a whole lot. From time to time they are wont to tell stories. Here’s what I know. I’d have a chance to talk with President Trump about his discussions with President Putin. There was progress made on a handful of fronts: agreements to try and work more closely on counterterrorism, an effort to begin conversations around arms control to prevent the spread of nuclear proliferation. There were lots of things discussed. There remains a great deal of work to do, but the President accomplished one of his goals, which was to create a way where the two leaders of these important countries can have positive, constructive conversations that surround these incredibly important issues. There’ll be lots of places our two countries’ interests and values diverge. President Trump’s deeply aware of that.


QUESTION: Any chance this administration would actually entertain the idea of allowing Putin or his – anyone from his team to have the ability to question or have physical custody of people like our former Ambassador McFaul or other DHS officials who’ve clearly been investigating things that are not beneficial to the Putin regime?


SECRETARY POMPEO: None.


QUESTION: Okay. Let’s talk North Korea, because tomorrow you head to the UN to have --


SECRETARY POMPEO: I answered that question, Shannon, that quickly because it – I’ve watched the noise these last few days. The President’s been very resolute. He understands precisely who it is we’re dealing with in Russia. He gets it. He’s trying to take opportunities, places where we find we can work together, and put America in a position to do the things he wants to do on behalf of the American people.


QUESTION: Okay. North Korea. Tomorrow you to the UN to have discussions about our ongoing conversations with them. What do you make of the reports and assessments that North Korea has no intention at all of getting rid of their nuclear ambitions or their program?


SECRETARY POMPEO: No one’s been closer to that than I have, so everyone else is simply speculating about what’s taken place to date. I’ve been there. The North Koreans have consistently reaffirmed their commitment, the commitment that Chairman Kim made to President Trump. No one was under any illusion that this was going to happen in hours or days or even weeks. It’s going to take time to achieve this outcome. We hope for a brighter future for the North Korean people, and if Chairman Kim continues to follow through on his commitment, the people of North Korea will have a brighter future.


QUESTION: Let’s talk about the historic meeting that you’ve put together, the ministerial-level meeting addressing religious freedom and persecution around the globe. Why was it important to you to do that?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Religious freedom is a fundamental human right. The State Department of the United States of America ought to be in the lead in promoting that religious freedom around the world. Shannon, not every country has the religious freedom we have here in the United States. Individuals are punished for their beliefs or, frankly, the absence of their beliefs. We ought to promote that around the world. I want the United States and our State Department to be front and center talking about religious freedom. Not every country will get to the place we want, but I’m confident that if we focus on this as part of American diplomacy, we can make the religious freedom for individuals all across the world at least a little bit better.


QUESTION: We have the case of the American pastor, Andrew Brunson, who is being held in Turkey, again yesterday denied freedom as what many are calling a sham trial continues on with him. Turkey is a NATO ally of ours. What can we do about that situation?


SECRETARY POMPEO: There’s been enormous work done by this administration to try and gain the release of Pastor Brunson. We also have others held in Turkey, other Americans that – excuse me – others who worked for the United States held in Turkey today. We’re working diligently on that case and, frankly, every place an American is held.


	This is one example of why religious freedom matters, and so we’re going to have over 80 delegations here at the State Department in a handful of days, 40 of my counterparts, foreign ministers. This is a historic opportunity. The Vice President will be speaking at the event. We believe that we can increase the capacity for human dignity and religious freedom by gathering the nations of the world and working together to get outcomes so we can prevent situations just like the one that Pastor Brunson is experiencing today.


QUESTION: Do you think that there are – you mentioned, obviously, our country is unique when it comes to the issue of religious freedom. How much do you think you can cut across some of those biases and other theocratic areas around the world where this is a real issue, life and death for many people?


SECRETARY POMPEO: It is indeed life and death. That’s why this ministerial gathering is so important. We’re under no illusions. We don’t think we’re going to change each of these countries to become as religiously tolerant as the United States is. But we’ve seen this every time we take an action to protect from anti-Semitism or protect Christian freedoms or protect others from across a broad range of religious faiths. Every time we act in that way and gather the nations of the world to talk about why that matters to make their country better, we think it’s real progress and we think every little increase in religious freedom is better for the world.


QUESTION: I wish you great success in that, Mr. Secretary.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Thank you, Shannon.

QUESTION: Welcome back to Washington Watch. I’m your host, Tony Perkins. So glad to have you with us. Wednesday, we had one of my fellow commissioners from the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom, Kristina, join us from Turkey with the news that American pastor Andrew Brunson was not going to be released from prison in Turkey, where he has been held for the last two years.


	Now, Pastor Brunson’s case is reflective of a growing threat to religious freedom and the spread of religious persecution around the globe that really has reached historic proportions, so much so that the Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has called for the first-ever Ministerial to Advance Religious Freedom, which will take place next week. The three-day event will bring together government officials, representatives of international organizations, religious leaders, rights advocates, and members of civil society organizations from around the world, and I’ll be there as well.


	With us now is the host of the event, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. Secretary, welcome to Washington Watch.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Tony, it’s great to be back on with you.


QUESTION: It’s been a while. And it’s great to have you on in this new capacity. And let me first just commend you for one of your first actions as Secretary is to call for this gathering of international leaders to discuss religious freedom.


	I want to start with the obvious question: Why?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Tony, it’s incredibly important in our administration, in President Trump’s administration, to make the case and sound the clarion call for religious freedom all around the world. You mentioned Pastor Brunson. There are many countries in which religious freedom is not available. And we believe that by gathering citizens from around the world – we’ll have over 80 delegations from different countries; forty-plus of my counterparts at the foreign minister level will be in attendance – and religious leaders like yourself all brought together to highlight the central nature of religious freedom, and it’s important to individuals and countries.


	We believe that religious freedom is important for every citizen around the world and we want to bring everyone together to discuss how all faiths have the right – people, individuals have the right to worship in the way that they choose, or if they choose not to. And every country ought to honor that.


QUESTION: Now, Mr. Secretary, you and I have been around government for quite some time. And a lot of times there’s a lot of meetings and there’s not always tangible outcomes. I know you’re a man of action. What do you hope will be the tangible outcomes of this gathering?


SECRETARY POMPEO: We expect, Tony, this to be far more than just talk. We do believe that just putting people together from all across the world in a room and talking about this topic will empower them to go back to their home country and advocate for religious freedom as well. It’s difficult, Tony, as you know, in many countries to even speak about religious freedom. And so we hope to provide a support system and a basis for some of them to head back to their own countries.


	But we’ll announce a number of initiatives. The Vice President will be speaking; Ambassador Brownback will be speaking there. And we will be laying out a path where we are hopeful that the State Department here in the United States can lead a process where religious freedom is raised as a priority for the citizens of every country. And we will have our teams in the subsequent weeks and months in the field talking about religious freedom on a continued basis. We’ll have just three days here, but this will be a mission of the State Department every day.


QUESTION: Now, Secretary Pompeo, this is the first ever, and I don’t want this to be lost on our listeners. As you pointed out, this issue of religious freedom, both domestically and from a foreign policy standpoint, is a priority for this administration. This is much more than lip service. I mean, this administration takes this serious.


SECRETARY POMPEO: You’ve seen that with President Trump very clearly. Look, we want people of all faiths – Christians, Muslims, Jews, people of all different faiths – we think that this forum will reinforce for countries that enjoy that religious freedom and encourage those that are on the cusp, who are in a place where it’s more challenging, will help provide them a courage to continue to make religious freedom a priority for the citizens of their own countries as well. This was laid out in the President’s National Security Strategy, which is unique and different from previous administrations. We do place a high priority on religious freedom and we can – we will continue to fight for it every place that we travel.


QUESTION: What has been the response from your counterparts around the globe?


SECRETARY POMPEO: It’s been remarkable. I literally, as I was traveling this past week – I think I was in six or eight different places – I had foreign ministers say, “I’m going to be there,” and I hadn’t seen the list. They’re excited to come be around others who believe religious freedom is important. I was in Muslim countries; I was in places with religions very different than my own Christian faith. But every one of those leaders was excited about the opportunity to gather with likeminded individuals who share the desire, the quest for every individual to be able to practice their faith in their country in the way that they wish to do.


QUESTION: And I know from my role at USCIRF that there’s actually countries that are on a waiting list. There’s people wanting to get to the --


SECRETARY POMPEO: (Laughter.) It is indeed oversubscribed, Tony, which we consider an enormous blessing.


QUESTION: It is.


SECRETARY POMPEO: And we’re going to do our best to accommodate each and every one of them so that they can come be part of this. And it bodes well for continuity for a program like this as well, not just these three days but to make sure that there are real actions that follow from this event.


QUESTION: One final question for you, Mr. Secretary. I know you’ve got a busy schedule. What can the average American do to bring greater awareness to this issue of religious freedom? Not just as an American right, but as the State Department and the United States Government recognizes this is a human right. What can we be doing?


SECRETARY POMPEO: It is deeply a human right. I think we can do a number of things. I think those of us who believe in faith and prayer can pray. I think it’s important for every individual to demand of their elected officials that they consider religious freedom among one of their priorities as they seek to lead and to be part of government service. And then I just think it’s important that groups – we have dozens and dozens of NGOs that will be attending this – to support groups like that and nongovernmental organizations that are prepared to help fight for religious freedom all around the world.


QUESTION: Do you anticipate seeing movement in countries like Turkey, like North Korea? I mean, do you really think this – during this Trump administration that we’re going to see movement?


SECRETARY POMPEO: We’ve seen some already. A good case in point would be Uzbekistan that has begun to move in the right direction. Tony, you know this is a long march, but absent leadership, absent the State Department engaging in this as an important priority, we know that the likelihood of it happening is less so. So we’ll work in every place to raise the awareness of the centrality of religious freedom not only for individual human dignity, but for success of nations as well.


QUESTION: Mr. Secretary, thank you so much for coming back on Washington Watch in your new capacity, and I look forward to seeing you next week at the ministerial.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Bless you, Tony. I look forward to seeing you next week as well. So long, sir.

	Our shared history has nurtured close cooperation. We support each other in our determination to foster democracy, to prevent the spread of global violence, and to promote prosperity worldwide. Together, we address 21st century challenges to ensure a safe and prosperous world for both our countries.


	The United States looks eagerly to a future of continued friendship and close cooperation between our two great nations.

QUESTION: Mr. Secretary, thank you very much for your time.


SECRETARY POMPEO: It’s wonderful to be with you today.


QUESTION: Long time – long day in Mexico City, right?


SECRETARY POMPEO: A wonderful day, a very – a productive day, and I was so happy to be able to be here.


QUESTION: Did you have time to eat some Mexican food at least?


SECRETARY POMPEO: We did not. We missed that, but next time.


QUESTION: Okay. How did the reunions today went?


SECRETARY POMPEO: The meetings were excellent. We wanted to get down here shortly after the election. The Mexican people should be very proud. The election showed that democratic processes are here and alive and well. They ran an excellent election, and we wanted to get down here to see the current administration of President Pena Nieto to say thank you for all the good work they’ve done alongside us during their time in office. They still have four and a half months where we’re going to work closely together, but then we also wanted to see President-elect Obrador and congratulate him and share with him the great things that can happen between our two countries.


QUESTION: What are your priorities, United States priorities?


SECRETARY POMPEO: I think they are very similar to the priorities of Mexico. I think we have many overlapping interests. We certainly want to make sure that economic development and jobs are created on both sides of the border. Perhaps that’s priority one. We need to make sure that we have a trade arrangement that’s fair and reciprocal. And a lot of work has gone into that, and I am very hopeful that we can actually accomplish something in the days and weeks ahead on the trade front.


	We want to make sure there iss security in both countries. I think that’s incredibly important, and there’s certainly an element of that will occur at the border in – between the United States and Mexico and in Mexico’s southern border as well. I think we can work closely. We have shared interest there. The lists of things that Mexico and the United States can do together is a long one, and we wanted to come down here and begin the conversations about those topics.


QUESTION: Irregular migration – such an issue between both countries, right?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Yes, it’s important to both countries to get that issue right.


QUESTION: So you went with the President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador. How did that meeting went?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Well, it was a wonderful meeting. I came with congratulations from President Trump. They had spoken by phone and had a wonderful conversation, and so we wanted to begin to develop relationships. We got a chance to meet with many of the senior officials that President-elect Obrador has designated to be our counterparts in the future, to develop those relations and begin to set out understandings about how we would work together to accomplish what can be great things between our two countries.


QUESTION: What about your meeting with President Pena Nieto?


SECRETARY POMPEO: It was wonderful. I’ve gotten to know him well over the years. He was gracious. He committed to working on the important matters. The world keeps moving, and so we all know that there can’t be four and a half months where no progress is made. And what I really believe is that the Pena Nieto administration has done good work. We’ve built a real platform where we can springboard the relationship as we begin to turn from this administration to the next one. We can really achieve great things. There will be difficulties. There will be challenges. Every bilateral relationship has them, but I am confident that if we work with good faith and good will, Mexico and the United States can do wonderful things together.


QUESTION: Five months until President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador takes office. These five months, how does – the relation will be between both countries?


SECRETARY POMPEO: The Pena Nieto administration is still in charge. They run the country through November 30th, so we will work with them. But what we saw was a fantastic relationship, actually, between the current administration and the incoming one as well, so I’m very confident that we will find ways to make sure that we’re achieving things that won’t only be accomplished in these next four and a half months but will be lasting benefits to each of our two countries.


QUESTION: What is the Trump administration doing to address the illegal drug problem issue between both countries?


SECRETARY POMPEO: That’s a really important question. We have enormous demand for drugs in the United States, but the President’s already done a great deal on the opioid front. He has created a task force which is working to diminish demand. There are security elements to this too; we can stop flows. But there are lots of things that the President has done. This is important. He issued an executive order early on in his time to reduce the demand for drugs on our side of the border.


QUESTION: So what’s the main topic you talked today with both presidents, President Pena Nieto and President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Oh goodness, I’m not sure there was a single main topic. We covered the waterfront. It wasn’t a day for long, detailed negotiations, but rather to begin to develop a set of understandings about how our two countries have the chance to do great things together, and that the two presidents have great respect for each other, and leadership always can drive good outcomes, and so I’m counting on that continuing in the weeks ahead.


QUESTION: How can you define, Mr. Secretary, the relationship between two countries, between the United States and Mexico? We’re neighbors. How can you define this relationship?


SECRETARY POMPEO: We have been neighbors for so long, we will be neighbors forever. We have to find ways to continue to make success possible for both sides. It’s not a zero-sum game between our two countries, and I’m confident that we can do that with this next administration in the same way we have with the current one. It’s – as I said before, it’s not the case that it’ll be perfect all the time. There will be places where we disagree. But I am confident that the value sets that our two nations hold are compatible and we can achieve things that benefit each of our two countries.


QUESTION: Are you concerned about NAFTA?


SECRETARY POMPEO: We have to get it right. President Trump’s made clear that was a priority. To make changes to NAFTA was a priority for him. But lots of progress has been made, and both in my meeting with President Pena Nieto as well as with President-elect Obrador, each of them made clear it was a priority for them to resolve the remaining outstanding issues, come to an agreement, and put that behind our two countries. If we do that, we’ll not only take an irritant out of the relationship, but we’ll have set the conditions for economic growth on both sides of the border.


QUESTION: Mr. Secretary, it’s been a pleasure.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Thank you.


QUESTION: Thank you very much for your time.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Thank you very much.


QUESTION: Welcome to Mexico always.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Thank you, ma’am.

MODERATOR: (Via interpreter) Good afternoon, and welcome to the Foreign Affairs Office. We are going to give a message to the media with the Secretary of State Michael Pompeo from the United States and the Chancellor Luis Videgaray Caso, if you could please say a couple of words.


FOREIGN SECRETARY VIDEGARAY: Buenas tardes. Good afternoon, I’m going to be speaking in Spanish, but I just want to say in English again welcome, Mike. Welcome back.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Thank you, Luis.


FOREIGN SECRETARY VIDEGARAY: (Via interpreter) Welcome. I would like to welcome the whole delegation from the State Department. Particularly we would like to welcome Mr. Jared Kushner, Senior Advisor to President Trump. It is a privilege for the Foreign Affairs Office and Mexico to receive you this afternoon and to have you with us today, as well as receiving the ambassador from Mexico in the United States, Geronimo Gutierrez.


	Today, as everyone knows, Mr. Pompeo along with Mnuchin, Secretary Mnuchin, Secretary for Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen, and Jared Kushner, as well as the delegation from the United States, they gathered in the official presidential residency with the President of Mexico Enrique Pena Nieto. It was a meeting that happened with a lot of respect between both governments. It was a very warm meeting, a meeting between work teams. We know each other. We have spent a lot of time together working trying to strengthen the relationship, the friendship that exists between our countries.


	During this meeting in Los Pinos, the president of Mexico reinforced and assured the American delegation as well as to Mr. Pompeo his commitment and the commitment of his government to continue to work until the final date of his government in November of this year to strengthen our relationship, particularly regarding to the Free Trade Agreement of North America. The president of Mexico mentioned the willingness and the commitment by the Mexican people and by his government to continue to work and doing so with speed to have a successful renegotiation of that agreement as soon as possible.


	The President of Mexico as well talked with Secretary Pompeo and the rest of the American delegation. They talked about the concern that exists in Mexico regarding the children that have been separated from their parents in the border and asked Mr. Pompeo and Secretary Nielsen as well as the rest of the delegation if they could do their best efforts to reunite the families as soon as possible.


	The meeting in general terms was a fruitful meeting, was a successful meeting to further improve the bilateral relationship between our countries. I would like to mention that President Enrique Pena Nieto has agreed with the current president, with the incoming president of Mexico, Andres Manuel Lopez Obador, to create a unified front, a front for Mexico. And this is how we are working regarding the relationship with the United States. Today we need to add efforts for Mexico. We will be working with the team from Mr. Lopez Obrador. We will be talking to him about the free trade agreement and the bilateral relationship. The President Enrique Pena Nieto is going to uphold his responsibility until November 30th, and he is going to do so with a very close communication with the team of Lopez Obrador as was agreed, and we are going to transmit this to Secretary Pompeo and to the American delegation that is with him.


	This is a moment of definition between the relationship of the United States and Mexico, but it’s also a moment for opportunity. President Enrique Pena Nieto and his work team will make our best efforts to capitalize on this opportunity in favor of Mexico and the United States and this great region that is North America.


	Again, Mr. Secretary, it is a privilege to have you here today with your delegation, and you are in your home.


MODERATOR: (Via interpreter) We would like to thank [Secretary] Videgaray for his words. And now we have the Secretary of State Michael Pompeo, if he could mention a couple of words.


SECRETARY POMPEO: All right. Luis, thank you so much for the kind words. It’s a true honor to be here in Mexico for my first trip as Secretary of State. I’ve been here many times before, but not since my new assignment. I want to thank President Pena Nieto for receiving us this morning and for our wide-ranging, candid discussion across a broad range of bilateral relationships – broad range of discussion of our bilateral relationship.


	I want to congratulate the people of Mexico on their historic election once again. It has demonstrated Mexico’s commitment to democracy. We look forward to working with President-elect Lopez Obrador after his inauguration on December 1st, and to that end it was a priority for me and our team to come to Mexico soon after the election to begin building our relationship with him and his team. In that visit with the President-elect Lopez Obrador, we discussed how Mexico and the United States can advance common goals, including strong economic growth, good jobs, and expanded opportunities for citizens of each of our two countries.


	The Trump administration will continue to work closely with Pena Nieto – with the Pena Nieto administration across our broad range of shared agendas. This includes our economic relationship, border and security issues, and the common regional and global priorities that each of our two countries hold dear.


	First, as America’s third-largest trading partner, it’s important for the United States to have a strong, fair, and reciprocal trade relationship with Mexico. Modernizing NAFTA to support the American worker is a key goal for the Trump administration, and we’re committed together to work forward on that. The United States will continue to work with Mexico and Canada on an updated agreement. We all agree that we want North America to remain the world’s most competitive and economically potent region.


	Second, we share nearly a 2,000-mile border. The United States is committed to making measurable progress that ensures the security on both sides of that border. Americans must be able to see improvements that better protect our national sovereignty and the safety of our local communities. I respectfully reinforced the importance of the border issue in each of our conversations today.


	We’ll also keep working to take on the threats of transnational criminal organizations that illegally traffic drugs, weapons, and human beings across our border in both directions. These brutal outlaws are responsible for spreading violence and undermining law in both – law and order in both of our countries. It must be stopped.


	And we recognize the demand for drugs is principally on the United States side of the border and that this problem is destroying communities and tearing families apart. It’s why President Trump has renewed efforts to prevent and treat addiction and to combat the flow of drugs coming into our country from abroad. With our shared resources and commitments, the United States and Mexico can make citizens on both sides of our border more secure.


	And finally, Mexico is an important and vital partner for regional and global challenges. As just one example, we’re working together to help our partners in El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras reduce insecurity and violence, enhance their economic opportunity, and fight corruption in their countries. Progress in these areas will reduce the irregular migration that undermines the security of both the United States and Mexico.


	Our meetings today reaffirmed that Mexico and the United States are neighbors, partners, and friends. I thank my Mexican hosts for their gracious welcome, and I look forward to visiting again soon. Thank you.


MODERATOR: (Via interpreter) Thank you, everyone, for your presence and good afternoon.

QUESTION: Mr. Secretary, thank you so much for making the time to speak to The National.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Of course, wonderful to be with you.


QUESTION: Thank you. I want to ask you about Iran, basically, because of course, here in the region, we have a lot of concerns about Iran’s expansionist policies, and you recently said that Ayatollah Khamenei has to be held to account for destabilizing the Gulf’s security. How can he be held to account?


SECRETARY POMPEO: So there are lots of ways. First, a united opposition is very important, and it’s one of the reasons I’m here. We have great partners here in the United Arab Emirates, we have great partners with the Saudis and the Bahrainis, many countries pushing back, demonstrating that what we’re asking is pretty simple: Iran to become a more normal country.


	The tools we’ll use will be varied. They’ll often be diplomatic. You see the U.S.-led efforts on sanctions, so economic tools. And then it’s also the case that we will be prepared to make sure that when Iran does things like launch missiles that come here or go to Riyadh, that we’re prepared to defend the region as well militarily.


QUESTION: The recent threat of closing the Strait of Hormuz is one that, of course, the whole world cares about. Is that a realistic threat?


SECRETARY POMPEO: The United States has made very clear we’re going to make sure that the sea lanes remain open. It’s been a longstanding U.S. policy and we’re prepared to make sure that that happens.


QUESTION: Now, if we look at Yemen, we see an uptick of activity from Hizballah and from Iran’s support for the Houthis. What can the international community do to stop that and how can we see an end to the war in Yemen?


SECRETARY POMPEO: So I do hope that there ultimately is a political resolution there. The UN, through Mr. Griffiths, is working hard to achieve that political resolution. But at the end of the day, it’s going to require a global effort to convince the Iranians that this kind of meddling, this kind of interference, this kind of promotion of violence directed at Arab countries outside of Yemen doesn’t make sense for them. And so all the same tools that I described previously are the ones that will ultimately lead to the Houthis and others in Yemen realizing that the war is not worth continuing, that a political resolution is the one that’s best for the people of Yemen.


QUESTION: (Inaudible) sorts of actions that can be taken in addition to, of course, the sanctions to convince the Iranians to change their behavior? Because what we’ve seen in the last few years is whatever pressure has not wielded the results you’re hoping for so far.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Well, remember the last few years, the sanctions were lifted. And so much of this malign activity, this increase in resources provided to Hizballah, the increase in resources provided to the Shia militias fighting in Iraq and in Syria, the support for the Houthis in Yemen, the efforts in Bahrain, those all took place against the backdrop of a relief from sanctions as a result of agreements that were entered into in the JCPOA. America has now withdrawn from those. These sanctions are returning. And I am convinced that the combined effort of the Gulf states and the United States and the Europeans will ultimately achieve a good outcome and convince the Iranian people that this is not the kind of activity their government ought to be involved with.


QUESTION: Are you working on an alternative deal when it comes to the nuclear activities of Iran? Do we expect another deal, a different type of deal?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Well, if there’s another deal, it’ll be completely different. It will be of permanent duration and not temporary. It will have a verification regime that is sufficient to ensure that nuclear weapons aren’t being hidden or developed in a clandestine way. And equally importantly, it won’t just be about the nuclear program. It’ll be about their space program, which is really a proxy for their missile efforts. It’ll be about their missile program, it’ll be about the malign activity, it will be a comprehensive effort to convince Iran to behave in a way that we ask every other country in the world to behave.


QUESTION: Iran’s presence in Syria is one that causes concern for Syrians and the region. Are you in talks with the Russians to work together to push out Iran and Hizballah’s influence in Syria?


SECRETARY POMPEO: So we have spoken with many parties in Syria, including the Russians, and made very clear, as have the Israelis, that the Iranian presence in Syria is not appropriate and won’t be tolerated. So we’re working diligently to develop a political solution that not only achieves America’s goal of defeating ISIS that’s still there, still a challenge for us in Syria, but leads Iran to the place where they conclude it’s not worth the candle for them to be in Syria. There’s no reason for them to reach out to that country. There’s no reason to have military forces on the ground there. And we’re going to undertake, along with our partners, a comprehensive program to diminish that activity.


QUESTION: We’ve seen some Iraqi militia forces in Syria under the leadership of Iranian military commanders or the IRCG commanders. What do you say to the Iraqi Government on that role that they’re playing?


SECRETARY POMPEO: So yes, Qasem Soleimani is causing trouble throughout Iraq and Syria, and we need to raise the cost for him, for he and his organization and for him personally. With respect to the Iraqi Government, we’re working closely with the Iraqis to make sure that as they move through their government formation process – as the election is now over, as they move through the government formation process, what America wants is an Iraqi – Iraq for Iraqis, not influenced by Iran but rather comprised of the various groups: the Kurds, the Sunnis, the Shias. We want everyone to have a voice in an Iraqi national government that leads to an Iraq that is strong and independent and robust and economically successful as well.


QUESTION: If we go back to Syria, is the U.S.’s position still that Assad must go?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Our first step is to take down the violence. The first thing that America’s working on politically is to reduce the level of violence. We have six million-plus displaced persons. We’ve got to restore the opportunity for the Syrian people to begin to engage politically and develop a stable, non-violent Syria. At that point, the political decisions, the constitution of Syria will be sorted out by the Syrian people.


QUESTION: And I want to ask you finally, on the issue of Qatar, as the Qatar crisis has developed, they’ve gotten closer and closer to Iran. So as this coalition is put together to face off on Iran’s activities in the region, what is your message to the Qataris on that?


SECRETARY POMPEO: My message and the President’s message to the entire Gulf (inaudible) is that we hope that they will begin to have discussions and resolve this dispute. We understand there are differences of views. This happens among countries with great frequency. But we do also recognize that these disputes lead to a strengthening of Iran, it allows Iran to create a wedge between Gulf states that have a shared threat from the Islamic Republic of Iran. And so we are hopeful and we are prepared to try and help facilitate to the extent we can a resolution of this set of disputes.


QUESTION: Okay. Thank you very much for your time.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Thank you, Mina.


QUESTION: I appreciate it.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Thank you very much.


QUESTION: Thank you.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Wonderful to meet you.


QUESTION: You too. It’s great to meet you and best of luck on your trip.

QUESTION: Mr. Secretary, thank you so much for being with us on Sky News. How are you doing


SECRETARY POMPEO: It’s wonderful to be with you.


QUESTION: Thank you. The United States is reinforcing various sanctions on Iran. We’ve heard statements over the last few days coming from Tehran that basically amount to threats, (inaudible) in the region, that – some went as far as threatening to close the Strait of Hormuz. How would the United States respond (inaudible) such threat?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Well, it all starts with Iranian bad behavior, the kinds of things that threaten the people here in the Emirates – missiles being launched from Yemen that strike real risk to the people of all of the Gulf states. And so American policy is aimed to deter that.


	I’ve seen these remarks about their threats. The world should know that America is committed to keeping sea lanes open, to keep transit of oil available for the entire world. That’s the commitment we’ve had for decades. We continue to honor that commitment.


QUESTION: Aside from the nuclear issue with Iran, Iran is involved (inaudible) in many destabilizing activities in several countries in the hemisphere: Yemen (inaudible), Syria. What will the United States do in order to limit these activities?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Well, one of the great things is we have wonderful partners like the Emirates, the Saudis, many countries, the Bahrainis are all working alongside of us to push back against Iranian malign behavior, whether it’s their activity underwriting the Houthis in Yemen, Hizballah in Syria and in Lebanon, in Iraq and Syria Shia militias that are inflicting real harm on ordinary citizens.


	So we intend to do a number of things, though one that we are most focused on today is ensuring that we deny Iran the financial capacity to continue this bad behavior. So it’s a broad range, a series of sanctions aimed not at the Iranian people, but rather aimed at the singular mission of convincing the Iranian regime that its malign behavior is unacceptable and has a real high cost for them.


QUESTION: Iran has said several times that they intend to stay in Syria for the long term. How does the United States view this?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Well, Iran needs to get out of Syria. They have no business there. There’s no reason for them to be there. There’s been Iranian influence there for a long time. Iranian forces, Iranian militias must leave the country.


QUESTION: Also on the issue of the Syrian (inaudible), there is a big (inaudible) going on south of Syria today. The armed groups that were supported at one time by the United States are losing ground. How are you looking at this?


SECRETARY POMPEO: It’s a very difficult situation. From the United States perspective, we need to achieve a political solution in Syria, one that reflects the diversity of the Syrian nation. We are aiming to set the conditions for a political resolution. We’re prepared to continue the conversations often led by the UN in a way that takes down the violence, de-escalates the threats to the people of Syria, allows the some six million displaced persons from Syria to begin to return and to rebuild, and that ultimately achieves a constitution and a political resolution that’s consistent with what the Syrian people truly want and deserve.


QUESTION: Are you in agreement with the Russians on what’s going on in the south of Syria today


SECRETARY POMPEO: No, we had an agreement with the Russians that they would not move in the south. There was a de-escalation zone that the Russians had agreed to. They now have clearly violated that and we are working with all parties concerned to get each party – the Russians, the Syrians, the Iranians, everyone to honor the commitments that they’ve made in the various political processes that have been undertaken with respect to Syria.


QUESTION: You had a tweet a few days ago saying that Iran’s activities in Yemen, the – (inaudible) the prolonged suffering of the Yemeni people will not be tolerated. What will Washington do in order to (inaudible)?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Well, we’ve done a lot of things. We’ve done work to push back against the threat of al-Qaida in Yemen. We’ve worked with the Saudis and with the Emiratis to reduce the risk from the Iranian threat there in Yemen through identifying transit of weapons that are moving in and around the region so that the Houthis don’t have the material to conduct these threats. We think it’s important that every place Iran attempts to use its force we raise the cost for them such that the Iranian people will ultimately reject that use of force.


QUESTION: The U.S. allies in Europe that were part of the 5+1 agreement with Iran are in talks with Iran right now in order to salvage what’s left of this agreement. How are you hoping talking to the Europeans about this and how are they responding?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Yeah, it’s a great question. I’ll actually leave here and headed for Brussels. I’ll meet with my European counterparts to talk about exactly this set of issues. Frankly, we agree in large part. The Europeans understand the threat that Iran poses. Indeed, just this past week, there were Iranians arrested in Europe who were preparing to conduct a terror plot in Paris, France. We’ve seen this malign behavior in Europe. The Europeans understand the threat. We are working through a difference. The American people concluded that the JCPOA made no sense, that it was truly a pathway for Iran to have a nuclear weapon. So we are attempting to stop that. We’re working now with the Europeans to develop a plan and a path forward to continue to stop Iran from its nuclear program, but also to push back against its missile system and its terrorist behavior.


QUESTION: Some countries in Europe and in other parts of the world intend to keep on getting oil from Iran even after the sanctions are imposed. How would you look at this?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Well, that will violate the sanctions that we put in place. Come November 4th, there will be a U.S. sanction that prevents crude oil from passing from Iran to other countries. It will be sanctionable activity. We will enforce those sanctions. There will be a handful of countries that come to the United States and ask for relief from that. We’ll consider it. But make no mistake about it, we are determined to convince the Iranian leadership that this malign behavior won’t be rewarded and that the economic situation in their country will not be permitted to be rectified until such time as they become a more normal nation.


QUESTION: There is an upcoming summit between President Trump and President Putin in Helsinki soon. Will Syria be a major topic to be discussed?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Oh, I’m confident that there will be a broad range of issues discussed. The issues in Ukraine with the Russians and this topic of Russian involvement in Syria will also be part of the conversation between the two leaders.

PRESIDENT GHANI: (Inaudible.) In the name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful. Mr. Secretary, it’s a unique pleasure to welcome you.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Thank you.


PRESIDENT GHANI: On behalf of the Afghan public, let me first thank the American men and women in uniform and civilians who have for 17 years fought shoulder-to-shoulder with us, and particularly those who have paid the ultimate sacrifice. Please convey our best wishes and gratitude particularly to Gold Star families. Over a million men and women in uniform have served with us. They will have a place in our hearts, and we are always moved to tears when they say they have left a piece of their heart in Afghanistan.


	I would like to thank you for the role – the critical role – that you played in the articulation and now the implementation of the South Asia strategy. Please thank President Trump and the members of the U.S. national security team for their trust in the future of Afghanistan and for bringing a strategy that has been a game-changer.


	Mr. Secretary, the strategy is working. It has had significant impact. It is getting every actor and stakeholder engaged in the conflict around Afghanistan to recalculate, recalibrate, and think through the basic premise. What we particularly welcome about the strategy is the concept of a secure Afghanistan within a stable South Asia.


	The objective of the strategy is to create the conditions for enduring peace and stability, and that’s what the Government of National Unity is committed to. Because of this strategy and condition-based nature of it, we the members of the Government of National Unity – my colleague Dr. Abdullah and I, and all the rest of our team – have been able to take bold steps, to think outside the box, and to articulate an agenda of peace that is truly comprehensive and asks for engagement.


	The ceasefire was equally an experiment, and here I’d like to pay tribute to the Afghan public. Our capacity not just to welcome reconciliation but to display a genuine sense of a nation that is tired of war, that is willing to look to the future rather than the past, that can take all the casualties of the week before the ceasefire and have the compassion and the commitment to reconcile, has been truly moving. It’s been moving for several generations of Afghans. After 40 years, Afghans have experienced a true Eid.


	I would also like to pay tribute to the Afghan public for their embrace of democracy. Over six million Afghans have registered to vote. A democratic election, a fair, free, and inclusive election, is what we characterize the routinization and the consolidation of our constitution.


	Equally, Mr. Secretary, our commitment to reform is strong, focused, and bearing results. Our security forces are experiencing a generational transformation. Their leadership and management is changing. Our commando forces are doubling. Our air force is tripling. They are showing both the way they managed the ceasefire that they have compassion for peace, but they have the discipline to defend this country and fight against the common threat of terrorism.


	And particularly the issue that we are concerned with is to thank first the American taxpayer and all of the government, members of the government, Congress, but to say that we want to focus on an approach that by 2024 this country would have considerable self-reliance. We have increased our revenues by 70 percent in the last four years, but you’ll redouble and triple that effort.


	A regional consensus, Mr. Ambassador – Mr. Secretary, is in the process of emerging. Your support for that, and also we are gratified at the Islamic engagement through the endorsement of fatwas by the imams of Makkah al-Mukarramah and Madina al-Munawarrah. It’s been a very strong statement.


	Let me welcome you as a friend. Let me welcome you as a leader. In your previous capacity you brought us massive change, positive change; and in your current capacity, again, we are looking forward to delivering on the anniversary of the South Asia strategy progress that would be discernible, measurable, an indication of the commitment of the Government of National Unity to our joint goals.


	Thank you, Mr. Secretary.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Thank you. Thank you, good afternoon. I want to thank you, President Ghani. I want to thank Dr. Abdullah and the entire Afghan National Security Council for hosting me here today. It’s been a pleasure to meet with you at the palace.


	On behalf of the American people, I want to express my deep appreciation for the American soldiers, Airmen, Marines, and sailors who are serving and sacrificing here alongside forces from NATO. I look forward to spending time with some of them after I leave here today.


	I also want to commend the brave Afghan warriors, soldiers, airmen, and police who risk their lives every day to made Afghans more secure and safer.


	Now, more than ever, the United States stands as an enduring partner for Afghanistan. It’s been almost one year since President Trump announced the new South Asia strategy. It features a conditions-based approach and the removal of artificial timelines and arbitrary troop ceilings. We’re working with the Afghan Government and security forces to set the conditions to produce a safer, more secure Afghanistan which is Afghan-led and Afghan-owned.


	You should know that the peace process is the same. The United States will support, facilitate, and participate in these peace discussions, but peace must be decided by the Afghans and settled among them. We expect that these peace talks will include a discussion of the role of international actors and forces.


	I came here today to learn the progress that we’d made in each of the dimensions. My conclusion from this visit is that the President’s strategy is indeed working. Our South Asia strategy has sent a clear message to the Afghan peoples and its security services that we will support them as they continue to fight to defend their country and their people.


	The strategy has sent a clear message too to the Taliban – they cannot wait us out – and we are beginning to see the results both on the battlefield where the Taliban’s momentum is slowing and in the prospects for peace with them.


	We’ve also today had the chance to discuss the progress Afghanistan is making to prepare for elections this fall. We support the Afghan Government and Security Forces as they work to ensure safe, credible, and transparent polls that reflect the will of the Afghan people. We call on all of our partners to continue this support.


	And finally, I’d like to congratulate the Government of Afghanistan on its progress towards reform. I’m encouraged to see the Afghan Government fighting corruption and developing a roadmap for its economy – for the country’s economy, including a clear vision for stable development of the mining sector.


	One again, President Ghani, thank you so much. Chief Executive Abdullah, thank you. You have been gracious hosts. The United States remains committed to working with the Afghan Government and the Afghan people to advance security, political stability, and accountability, along with democratic governance among the Afghan people. Thank you.


MR CHAKHANSURI: Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you, Mr. Secretary. We’ll take some questions now.


	Hoshidi from Shamshad.


QUESTION: Thank you very much. I am Zabihullah Khurshidi, Shamshad TV reporter. Welcome, U.S. Secretary of State! The Taliban recently rejected peace talks with the Afghan government and didn’t accept the ceasefire. They have found new partners in the region, including Iran, Russia, China, and Pakistan, which have been accused of supporting the Taliban for a long time. What is the U.S. stance and the next plan specifically on Afghanistan’s peace process?


SECRETARY POMPEO: I’m sorry, I --


PRESIDENT GHANI: Was it translated?


SECRETARY POMPEO: No, I didn’t get that. My --


MR CHAKHANSURI: So the question is that the peace process, the Taliban has rejected peace dialogues and negotiations and they now have some partners in the region as well, with – partnership with some other countries. What are the next steps and how will we proceed with the peace process?


SECRETARY POMPEO: So the peace process will be Afghan-led. It will be amongst the Afghan people. We have been very encouraged following the ceasefire to see how the Afghan people have responded to that. We think that bodes well for the peace process. Having said that, we are prepared to participate in that, to facilitate, to help the Afghan people resolve their differences and to arrive at a place where all of the Afghan people can have their voices heard and live in a society that is peaceful and security and where every Afghan is treated with the dignity that each of them deserves.


MS NAUERT: The next question will go to Kylie Atwood from CBS News. One question, please.


QUESTION: Thank you. Secretary Pompeo, the U.S. has now been here in Afghanistan for almost 17 years, as you well know, and the Trump administration, as you said, is one year into its strategy, a conditions-based strategy, but there aren’t many signals of success. The territory under Taliban control has grown. And as you noted, an American service member just died here. This is the third fatality of an American military member this year. You say the strategy is working, but where is the evidence that Trump and his administration’s strategy here is indeed working?


	And the U.S. has also said it would facilitate talks between the Afghan Government and the Taliban. Can you characterize U.S. engagement with the Taliban at this point? Thank you.


SECRETARY POMPEO: So that was two questions.


QUESTION: Both on Afghanistan.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Interestingly, they’re connected. An element of the progress is the capacity that we now have to believe that there is hope that many of the Taliban now see that they can’t win on the ground militarily. That’s – they’re – deeply connected to President Trump’s strategy. We saw this. We saw what happened. We saw the Taliban respond to the ceasefire that President Ghani put in place. These are linked issues. The progress we’ve made in the South Asia strategy in increasing the size and the capability of the Afghan Security Forces, in strengthening the reforms inside the Afghan Government; the work that we have done to demonstrate to the Taliban that the continuation of fighting will lead them to a bad outcome, not one that’s in the best interests of the people in the regions where they operate – each of those are hallmarks of real progress.


	Make no mistake, there’s still a great deal of work to do. That is certainly the case, and the American role will be important in this. But we can’t run the peace talks. We can’t settle this from the outside. This will be settled by the Afghan people coming together, their cumulative realization that living together in harmony and peace, treating each other with dignity – we saw that during the ceasefire and we have seen it in the aftermath. We are very hopeful that that will lead to a successful reduction in violence as we move into the elections.


	We’re counting on all the actors in the region to be supportive of that. The Pakistanis too need to understand that they need – we need to have a set of elections that do not have violence. We’re counting on all of the actors in the region to support this process and make sure the Afghan people can have their voices heard during these elections. We think each of those is greatly increased as a result of the strategy that President Trump laid out now almost 12 months ago.


MR CHAKHANSURI: Thanks. We will take the third question from Ariana News’ Mr. Shapoor. Only one question, please.


QUESTION: Thanks. I am Shapoor Farahmand, Ariana News reporter. My first question goes to Mr. President. Since the Taliban has rejected the ceasefire twice and didn’t accept the Afghan government’s peace offer, has the government of Afghanistan had any other opportunity to negotiate peace talks thoroughly and end the conflict? My second question goes to Mr. Secretary –


MR CHAKHANSURI: Sorry, only one question, please. One question only. Thank you.


PRESIDENT GHANI: Thank you. I hope we do not see only the dark side of everything. I would like to tell all of my fellow citizens that within the last 40 years, had anyone before witnessed a ceasefire? If you have not seen a ceasefire for the last 40 years, now you have. The importance of this issue shouldn’t be ignored. The initiative of the ceasefire and the Kabul Peace Process Conference was ours.


	The reason why this initiative took place during this time is because with our key partner, the United States, we have come up with a strategy that is not bounded or based on time, but based on actual ongoing conditions. Each peace accord is the result of astonishing effort. We need to keep some fundamental points in mind here.


	First, we need to know whether there is a national consensus on peace in our country or not. The answer to this question is that a vast majority of the Afghan people definitely supports peace. Second, has the national consensus led to actions to draw a clear roadmap? Once the ceasefire took place, what are now the basic barriers to the next ceasefire? Third, the role of the respected ulema of Afghanistan is unprecedented. 2,907 of our religious leaders came together, issued a fatwa, and their recommendation was peace, and the Government of National Unity welcomes peace.


	We need to take future steps in a very careful, tolerant, and courageous manner. For instance, if there is not much effort in school, a student may not take the first position, and if you want to climb a mountain, you need to traverse the path to the top. The roadmap is clear for now, so we need to have clear will and determination, as well as patience. It is unrealistic to expect to solve a 40-year crisis in one day. However, the current movement has created hope in people.


	And the last point: our security and defense forces have demonstrated discipline in welcoming peace and at the same time showing that they are strongly willing to defend this homeland. I want to express my gratitude to the security forces, and I am really proud of them. I have visited four Afghan National Defense and Security Force corps, including our commandos and special forces, but we have to understand that we cannot rely only on our security forces, but the stage has been set for political and social negotiations, which I believe will move forward smoothly, inshallah. Thank you.


MS NAUERT: Next question, John Hudson from The Washington Post.


QUESTION: Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Secretary. Just given the importance of the North Korea issue, I wanted to ask you: Yesterday, you put out the prospect of offering security guarantees to North Korea as it starts the denuclearization process. What are those security guarantees? Does it include an agreement to formally end the Korean War? Would you consider removing U.S. troops or weapons systems?


	And after your visit in Pyongyang, North Korea issued a pretty aggressive statement. I was just wondering – you’ve spent so much time building this relationship, seeing what’s happening, visiting Pyongyang – did you get a sense of what was the issue that really triggered North Korea to walk away with a different sentiment that you had in the good-faith negotiations? Thanks very much.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Well, I’d really prefer to talk about Afghanistan given where we are. Do you have a question about Afghanistan?


QUESTION: Oh, and also on Afghanistan, I would also like to ask what your view is of Russia’s involvement in Afghanistan. Do you believe that it is supplying arms to the Taliban? But also wonder if you’d be generous enough to answer the North Korea question as well.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Yeah. So let me talk about regional actors here in Afghanistan more broadly even than Russia. We are – we have seen good signs from lots of regional actors, China and others, who – Uzbekistan – who are stepping forward. We’ve also seen it from our NATO allies and partners. We’ve had 29 of 39 of those allies step up with increased contributions of resources since President Trump announced his new South Asia strategy.


	We believe that there are many actors who are coming together to try and achieve what it is President Ghani has so elegantly discussed today. We truly – we’re optimistic that the region, the world are all tired of what’s taking place here in the same way the vast majority of the Afghan people no longer wish to see violence and war. And we’re very, very hopeful that over the coming periods, we can begin to see true progress, true reductions in violence, sound reforms of the Afghan Government that result from the Afghan people’s voice being heard in the upcoming elections. If we can begin to move down that path, we will have made a historic pivot, a historic change, transformational work here in Afghanistan which will give the Afghan people back their country in a way that is important and, frankly, what I’m convinced most of the Afghan people want.


	Let me close – I’ll give you one quick answer with respect to North Korea. We still have a long ways to go, but the commitment that the North Koreans made – frankly, that Chairman Kim personally made to President Trump – remains, has been reinforced. I saw some of the statements came out. They were mixed. You haven’t reported on the mixed statements, but maybe you will now. The statements that were put out, Chairman Kim’s statement following our discussions, continued to express his desire to complete the denuclearization to which he is so committed.


MS NAUERT: John, thank you. John, thank you.


MR CHAKHANSURI: The press briefing is concluded. Thank you, everyone, for coming out today.

	On behalf of the Government of the United States of America, we extend our best wishes to the people of the Republic of South Sudan on the seventh anniversary of their nation’s independence.


	This should be a day of celebration marking South Sudan’s emergence as an independent state and the beginning of a new era of greater peace and prosperity. Instead, the conflict that broke out in December 2013 continues to impose immense suffering on South Sudan’s diverse citizens. They have already paid a heavy price for their leaders’ divisions: driven from their homes, facing life-threatening hunger, and subjected to unspeakable cruelty.


	As talks among the parties continue, we remember the struggle of generations of South Sudanese for a better future. But for July 9 to be a real celebration, the fighting must stop everywhere, and South Sudanese leaders must make the tough choices to put aside narrow self-interest and put the needs of the nation first. We call upon the Government of South Sudan and all parties to the conflict to immediately stop the bloodshed and genuinely resolve their differences through dialogue that reflects the voices of a broad spectrum of society. Only when the fighting stops can South Sudan begin on a path towards inclusive economic growth and genuine reconciliation.


	The United States remains a friend of the South Sudanese people. We stand ready to work with responsible leaders who are willing to deliver the peace, opportunity, and justice the people of South Sudan have long awaited.

PRIME MINISTER ABE: (Via interpreter) I’d first like to extend a warm welcome on your first visit to Japan as the Secretary of State. And also I would like to pay my tribute to your strong leadership that you have demonstrated in negotiating with North Korea. I highly value your first visit to Japan and its timing, being right after your visit to North Korea for your negotiation with the North Korean side. And this clearly shows the unwavering bond under the Japan-U.S. alliance and also between myself and President Trump, which has become robust, more so than ever.


	Having the settlement of the outstanding issues of concern surrounding North Korea, including nuclear missile and abduction issue, will be extremely important for Japan, but also that will be extremely important for regional peace and stability.


	And also in this context, at the most recent historic summit meeting between the United States and North Korea, President Trump directly conveyed to Chairman Kim Jong-un what I asked him to raise and also what I explained to the President in advance with regard to the abduction issue, and I certainly appreciate that.


	So today I look forward to having your feedback as well as takeaways on the current status of the negotiation between the United States and North Korea, and also we would like to stand firmly together for the settlement of the outstanding issues of concern through the robust coordination as well as collaboration between Japan and the United States.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Prime Minister Abe, first of all, thank you for taking time to meet with me. President Trump asked me to convey his warmest regards and his deep appreciation for his personal relationship with you and the partnership between our two countries.


	I look forward to our discussion about my visit to North Korea. We raised a full range of issues with them with respect to their nuclear program, to the abductee issue – all of the issues that I know matter to the United States, Japan, and indeed to the world.


	Mr. Prime Minister, you personally and Japan have been great partners of the United States. The foreign minister has been a great partner to me, and we’re deeply appreciative for that, and there is much work for us to do together, and I’m honored to be with you here today to discuss how we can do that together.

I’m Dan Kritenbrink, the American ambassador to Vietnam, and I am deeply gratified to see heretonight so many friends of the U.S.-Vietnam partnership. This is a very special evening. We are joined by Secretary Pompeo, who is in the midst of an incredibly important worldwide trip. We are exceptionally honored that the Secretary has decided to visit Vietnam and to spend this evening with us.


	So I now ask that you please join me in warmly welcoming the Secretary of State of the United States of America, the Honorable Michael Pompeo. (Applause.)


SECRETARY POMPEO: This reminds me of church – come on, the front pews are open. Come on. (Laughter.) It’s great to – I see two of the – they may have my remarks up here, and I’m well known for deviating from them. So if there’s a – if there’s confusion, I’m right and that’s wrong. (Laughter.)


	Good evening. Thanks, everyone, for joining me here tonight. It is the case that this is my first trip to Vietnam. It’s the first time as Secretary of State I’ve had the opportunity to come to Southeast Asia, and I very much wanted to come to this country. It is a special place with a rich and deep history. For America, as someone who served in the United States Army, I understand and know the history and am so proud of what our two countries have been able to do together over the last decades.


	I want to thank Ambassador Kritenbrink for putting this all together and making this happen tonight. He has also been central in his work to level the playing field for American businesses here. I hope both American and Vietnamese businesses and leaders will keep building this close relationship; it will benefit each of our two countries and your businesses as well. And I understand that Vice Minister Ngoc, our soon-to-be new ambassador, is here as well? Yes? Good to see you again. Thank you. Thank you for joining us tonight. I can’t wait for you to get to Washington. We’ll love to see you there.


	You know, I’ve had some time to reflect over the last couple of days on my visit to Vietnam. I was – I was a kid during the Vietnam War. It was all around me growing up. It was every night on TV. We all remember Walter Cronkite telling us the news about what was going on here. I knew a number of families in the community that I grew up in where they had sons and fathers that didn’t come home. It was a difficult time in America’s history and in Vietnam’s history as well.


	But look where we are today. It’s truly remarkable. I was just in a meeting with the general secretary and it was amazing to think that I was there as an American secretary. Would someone in the ‘60s or ‘70s have had any hope or believe that the American secretary of state would have great conversations with Vietnam’s top political leaders, where we’ve shared a common vision of how we would move forward together? Would someone back at that time have believed that the American secretary of state would be giving a speech about how we can keep growing our business and economic relationships, our partnership with Vietnam? I think it was unlikely that anyone could have predicted that.


	And the fact that we’re having this conversation tonight is a true testament to our nations’ common interests, our mutual respect, our bold resolve, despite great difficulties, to overcome the past and look forward to the future.


	I say all of that because it’s important, but I hope that the United States, that one day we can share the same relationship with North Korea. We know it’s a real possibility because we see how Vietnam has traveled this remarkable path. In the early 1980s, Vietnam was in a very [different] condition than it is today: millions had been lost in a series of terrible wars, including, of course, one with the United States. Millions were still looking for reliable supplies of food and shelter. And with the country having endured one conflict after another in previous decades, Vietnam’s political leaders and military leadership constantly worried about the possibility of new conflict as well. And except for relations with a handful of communist nations, Vietnam at that time was isolated from the world.


	But this trying time also presented opportunities for Vietnam. The leaders of Vietnam realized their country could reform, it could open up and build relationships, without threatening the country’s sovereignty, its independence, and its form of government. One key to Vietnam’s enormous rise over the past few decades was a new engagement with the United States of America. This began when the U.S. – the United States and Vietnam began working together to repatriate the remains of American service members lost in Vietnam. This small but incredibly meaningful first step eventually helped lead to better ties and formal reestablishment of our relationship in 1995.


	This is the same issue that the United States faces today with Chairman Kim, where new ties with America combined with the industriousness of the Vietnamese people and sound leadership has made Vietnam an incredible success story today. It has the fastest-growing economy in all of Southeast Asia. In the past two decades, bilateral trade overall has grown by 8,000 percent. In the last decade alone, U.S. exports to Vietnam have increased by over 300 percent and American companies have poured billions in investment into this country, with great returns. And the Vietnamese people have experienced an extraordinary improvement in their economic wellbeing as well. By global standards, over 60 percent of the Vietnamese people lived under the poverty level in the early ‘90s; today that number is less than 10 percent.


	And importantly, the growth between the United States and Vietnam encompasses a great deal – more than just economics, by far. Politically, our engagement with the Vietnamese leaders has reached new heights. Secretary Mattis visited Vietnam in January. Just last month, Deputy Prime Minister Hue visited me at the State Department. And of course, President Trump made his first visit to Vietnam last year.


	In the past, we were opponents on the battlefield, but today our security relationship is all about cooperation. Last March, the USS Carl Vinson visited Da Nang, the first U.S. aircraft carrier to visit the country since the end of the war. And following the lifting of the U.S. arms embargo just two years ago, our two militaries are looking at ways to improve our security cooperation even further. The fact that we’re cooperating and not fighting is proof that when a country decides to create a brighter future for itself alongside the United States, we follow through on American promises. And while there are still challenges in our relationship with Vietnam, the fact that we can have honest yet calm discussions when we disagree is an even greater confirmation of the relationship between our two nations.


	And finally, look at the consequences of American engagement on the leadership and people of Vietnam. Prosperity and security abound. When the leaders in Hanoi go to bed at night, the notion of conflict with America is the last thing on their minds. Instead, they rest with a certainty that America has no interest in reopening the old wounds of the past. And in light of our red-hot trade relationship and growing security cooperation, nothing could be further from America’s self-interest than picking a fight with Vietnam.


	In light of the once-unimaginable prosperity and partnership we have with Vietnam today, I have a message for Chairman Kim Jong-un: President Trump believes your country can replicate this path. It’s yours if you’ll seize the moment. The miracle could be yours; it can be your miracle in North Korea as well.


	The United States has been clear about what we seek from North Korea to set in motion this great chain of events. The choice now lies with North Korea and its people. If they’re able to do this, they will be remembered and Chairman Kim will be remembered as a hero of the Korean people.


	I want now to shift gears just a bit. I want to state clearly that a free and open Indo-Pacific region is a true priority for the United States of America. As President Trump’s National Security Strategy and his speech at APEC last November in Da Nang have made clear, the United States is dedicated to an Indo-Pacific region with strong, independent nations who respect each other’s sovereignty, uphold the rule of law, and advance responsible commerce. We hope these principles will guide governments and businesses of the Indo-Pacific region as they make the choice about their partners. We hope they will see that the United States' actions are not guided by raw economic self-interest alone, in contrast with others in the region. The United States seeks partnerships in the region built on the values of respect, fairness, and the rule of law.


	A free and open Indo-Pacific is vital to the continued growth of commerce between our two nations. During President Trump’s meeting with President Quang last November, our two leaders pledged to deepen our trade and economic relationship. We’ll continue to do this. We will promote free, fair, and reciprocal trade and investment in priority areas. This includes digital trade, intellectual property rights enforcement, automobiles, electronic payments, and agricultural goods. Across the board, we’ll press for open, transparent, and competitive markets and trade and investment opportunities for American companies.


	President Trump has also emphasized to Vietnam the importance of reducing our trade imbalance. We need to resolve these issues that impede American companies’ access to markets here in Vietnam. I hope to hear your ideas tonight and talk to many of you about how we can make progress on eliminating those barriers to American goods so that each of our two countries will be better off.


	We are committed to continuing to work for a strong, prosperous, and independent Vietnam, one that engages in fair and reciprocal trade. And even as we focus on the future, we will both cooperate on resolving past conflict. This includes collaboration to provide a full accounting for all missing personnel and to remediate the lingering impact of dioxin in this country.


	I’m looking forward to tonight. I’ve been looking forward to it for a number of days since Dan told me we had successfully put it together. We’ll have good conversations about how we can all grow our mutual prosperity. With your help, the Americans and Vietnamese in this room, we can make sure that Vietnam continues to be a model for aspiring nations, no matter where they are in their journey towards a brighter future. Thank you again so much for your warm welcome and for being with me tonight. I look forward to (inaudible). Thank you. (Applause.)

"July 8, 2018","
MODERATOR: (In progress) the Japan-U.S.-ROK joint press conference by Mr. Taro Kono, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Japan; Mr. Mike Pompeo, Secretary of State of the United States; and Dr. Kang Kyung-wha, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Korea.


	First, I would like to invite Minister Taro Kono to make a statement. Mr. Kono, please.


FOREIGN MINISTER KONO: Thank you. It is my glad pleasure to welcome Secretary Mike Pompeo and Minister Kang Kyung-wha to Tokyo for this trilateral foreign ministers’ meeting. The last time we gathered in Seoul was less than a month ago, immediately after U.S.-North Korea summit in Singapore. The timing and the frequency of the meeting have enabled smooth and effective trilateral coordination; its outcome could then be fed into the process between the U.S. and North Korea.


	The responsibility Secretary Pompeo assumed after the summit in Singapore is very significant, and Minister Kang and I stand hand-in-hand with Secretary Pompeo to support him all the way till the end.


	I would also like to pay tribute to the earnest effort by Minister Kang to serve as a bridge between U.S. and North Korea. Her effort has paved the way for the subsequent summit in Singapore.


	Today, we were able to reaffirm our unwavering commitment to continue strengthening of our trilateral cooperation towards the common goal of North Korea’s complete, verifiable, and irreversible dismantlement of all weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missiles of all ranges.


	We have also had in-depth discussion on how we can cooperate to urge North Korea to take concrete actions towards the full implementation of relevant United Nations Security Council resolutions, and we confirmed that security assurance will be provided to North Korea, as agreed in the summit in Singapore.


	At the same time, we have reaffirmed that international community will continue to fully implement relevant UN Security Council resolutions in order to materialize CVID. Japan continues to seek normalize its relations with North Korea in accordance with Pyongyang Declaration through comprehensively resolving outstanding issues of concern such as nuclear missile and abductions issue, as well as through the settlement of the unfortunate past.


	We wish to initiate a new start for our relations with North Korea. Japan is determined to continue playing a major role in realizing peace and stability in Northeast Asia in close coordination with United States and ROK. In this regard, I am very much looking forward to continue working closely with both Secretary Pompeo and Minister Kang in coming month.


	Thank you very much.


MODERATOR: Thank you very much. Now let us invite Secretary Mike Pompeo. Secretary, please.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Thank you. It’s an honor to be here on my first trip to Tokyo as the Secretary of State for the United States of America, and I am thrilled to be here. Thank you, Foreign Minister Kono, for hosting me. Foreign Minister Kang, thank you so much for all the help you have provided me in the days since the Singapore summit.


	Before I talk about North Korea, I want to say that we are closely following the news of the flooding and landslides that are hitting western Japan. The United States expresses its deep condolences to the families of those who died, and we send our thoughts and prayers to the families who are injured or missing. To our Japanese friends, the American people stand with you as you recover from this tragedy.


	As we build on the momentum of President Trump and Chairman Kim Jong-un’s historic summit, the United States, the Republic of Korea, and Japan continue to strengthen our trilateral cooperation to achieve the goals set out in Singapore. To that very end, today’s meeting was a top priority after my talks in North Korea these past days.


	Over two days, my team and I met with Vice Minister Chairman Kim Jong-ul – chul – Kim Yong-chul and his colleagues. We had good-faith, productive conversations which will continue in the days and weeks ahead. In the meantime, sanctions remain in place, and we will continue to enforce them with great vigor.


	During the visit, we intended to build upon the agreements made by President Trump and Chairman Kim, and we made progress. But first let me make clear North Korea reaffirmed its commitment to complete denuclearization. We had detailed and substantive discussions about the next steps towards a fully verified and complete denuclearization.


	In addition, North Korea agreed to meet in mid-July in Panmunjom to discuss the repatriation of remains of our American service members. North Korea also reaffirmed its earlier commitment to destroy its missile engine test site, which will make the region and the world safer. We also established a working-level team that will carry out the day-to-day work of our two sides.


	Yep, the road ahead will be difficult and challenging, and we know critics will try to minimize the work that we’ve achieved. But our allies, like the Republic of Korea and Japan, President Trump and I believe that peace is worth the effort. And that’s something that we all want. As allies we share and are committed to the same goal – the fully verified, final denuclearization of North Korea, as agreed to by Chairman Kim Jong-un.


	As President Trump has said, there is no limit to what North Korea can achieve if it gives up its nuclear weapons. Should the DPRK follow through on its commitments, we look forward to eventually helping North Korea obtain prosperity and earn the respect of the world; however, North Korea will first have to fulfill its commitments to denuclearize. Sanctions will remain in place until final, fully verified denuclearization, as agreed to by Chairman Kim, occurs. Multiple UN Security Council resolutions unanimously passed require all nations to fully enforce those sanctions. Our three countries will continue to be vocal in reminding each country of its obligations to do so.


	And so while we are encouraged by the progress of these talks, progress alone does not justify the relaxation of the existing sanctions regime. There is also no change to our ironclad commitment to the defense of our allies, the Republic of Korea and Japan. The security of our allies is integral to our American security. The United States looks forward to continuing our close coordination with Japan and South Korea as we achieve the successful implementation of the agreement that was achieved at the Singapore summit.


	Thank you.


MODERATOR: Thank you very much. Lastly, let us invite Minister Kang Kyung-wha. Minister, please.


FOREIGN MINISTER KANG: Thank you very much. Welcome, ladies and gentlemen of the press. It is indeed a distinct honor for me to be here with Secretary of State Mr. Mike Pompeo and my Japanese counterpart, Foreign Minister Taro Kono, here in Tokyo so soon after Secretary Pompeo’s third visit to Pyongyang.


	But first of all, let me also reiterate the sentiment expressed by Secretary Pompeo about the terrible losses caused by the torrential rain and flooding in western Japan. Our thoughts are very much with the families and communities affected by this climactic event, and we wish them, the government, swift recovery and our greatest sympathies to the families affected.


	Secretary Pompeo’s visit to Pyongyang, his third one, this visit having taken place in follow-up to the historic U.S.-North Korea summit, has been a productive starting point for implementing the agreements reached between President Trump and Chairman Kim in Singapore. Today’s meeting among the three of us underscores the unwavering commitment on the part of our three countries to achieve the shared goal of complete denuclearization and the establishment of lasting peace and – on the Korean Peninsula.


	First and foremost, I would like to express my deepest gratitude and admiration to Secretary Pompeo for his tireless efforts to advance the dialogue with North Korea with a great deal of patient and deep commitment to turning this historic opportunity into reality of a nuclear-free, peaceful Korean Peninsula.


	At today’s meeting, Secretary Pompeo explained to us in detail the results of his visit to North Korea and gave us a good sense of the work going forward, including the meeting scheduled at Panmunjom on July 12th regarding the return of the POW/MIA remains, but for further consultations to be had with North Korea going forward.


	In the two rounds of the inter-Korean summits and last month’s U.S.-North Korea summit, the three leaders clearly set the direction towards our shared goal, and Secretary Pompeo’s visit to Pyongyang this time has taken the first steps in that direction. And we expect there to be – these to be followed up by further constructive and productive negotiations between the U.S. and North Korea, and the Republic of Korea stands ready to provide whatever assistance is needed to move the dialogue along.


	The Security Council sanctions, as we have agreed in our trilateral meeting, will remain in place and faithfully implemented until we are assured of complete denuclearization by North Korea. North Korea’s denuclearization and provision of security guarantees and economic development that it desires must move together in our joint efforts to chart a brighter future towards lasting peace and prosperity on the Korean Peninsula and indeed beyond in this region.


	This was the blueprint set forth in President Moon’s speech in Berlin a year ago, as well as the vision that President Trump and Chairman Kim agreed to in Singapore. And therefore, it is thus in the interest of all that we move forward expeditiously in this endeavor.


	We have also confirmed once again that the ROK-U.S. alliance is firm and strong and will remain so during this process of North Korea’s denuclearization. We have made it clear that decisions to suspend certain parts of the ROK-U.S. joint military exercises, including the UFG, has been taken jointly with the aim of encouraging North Korea to actively and expeditiously engage in the denuclearization process, and that our combined defense posture will remain ironclad. Our two countries will continue to maintain watertight coordination in any and all issues related to the ROK-U.S. alliance.


	In closing, may I once thank again my counterparts, Minister Kono and Secretary Pompeo, for the show of solidarity that our three countries have maintained as we have and will continue to engage on the issue of North Korea’s complete denuclearization and lasting peace on the Korean Peninsula.


	Thank you very much.


MODERATOR: Thank you very much. Now we would like to move on to the Q&A session. Those who wish to make – ask a question, please raise your hand. Upon my appointing, please move to the nearest microphone and identify yourself with your name and media outlet.


	Please kindly be advised to make your questions succinct. Now the floor is open. The lady in the front seat.


QUESTION: Thank you. This is Ryo Kiyomiya from Asahi Shimbun, Japanese newspaper company. I have two questions. First, I would like to ask each of you, recently the U.S. defines its goal as final, fully verified denuclearization of North Korea instead of CVID – complete, verifiable, and irreversible denuclearization. It seems softer than CVID. My question is: Will the U.S., Japan, and South Korea continue to work towards CVID of North Korea? And what do you think is the difference between CVID and final, fully verified denuclearization?


	And my second question is about the abduction issue of the Japanese. Secretary Pompeo, you said you raised the abduction issue of the Japanese during your visit to North Korea. We would like to know the detail and response from North Korea. Secretary and Minister Kang, how will the U.S. and South Korea work with Japan on this abduction issue?


	(Via interpreter) And my question is to Minister Kono regarding the Japanese policy on countering or reacting to these issues. Thank you.


FOREIGN MINISTER KONO: (Via interpreter) First, I would like to respond to your question. With respect to related resolutions of the Security Council, it clearly stipulates that North Korea must dismantle in a method – complete and verifiable, irreversible method dismantle the WMD as well as the ballistic missiles. So it is clearly stipulated that CVID is demanded in the resolutions.


	As far as we are concerned, we would like to continue to work toward North Korea so that North Korea would completely implement the Security Council’s resolution. We are completely in agreement on that.


	In terms of the international community, we are in agreement. For me, see, instead of CVID denuclearization of Korean Peninsula, sometimes I refer to this phrase. But even in doing so, what I mean is to look toward the dismantlement of all weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missiles of all ranges, at least as Security Council stipulates certain goals. And that should be solidly implemented by North Korea, and we have to demand North Korea to do that. We have – we are unchanged in that goal. So the words may be different and there is no much – not much significance in the different phrases and words that we may use.


	Now on the question of abduction, from Secretary Pompeo this time around the issue was raised, and I’d like to thank him for raising the issue at the meeting. Regarding the reaction from North Korea, I will refrain from making any comment.


	As far as Japan is concerned, the U.S. and North Korean negotiations should advance furthermore, and we’d like to work in tandem with the international community so that Security Council resolution-based sanction can be solidly implemented regarding North Korea.


	Thank you.


FOREIGN MINISTER KANG: Yes. Should I go?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Yes, sure. Go ahead.


FOREIGN MINISTER KANG: Well, I think our goal remains complete denuclearization, and I think the FFVD, as used by Secretary Pompeo, isn't any softer in stating our shared goal of complete denuclearization. Obviously, terms have historical context, and this has been somewhat difficult for North Korea to signed onto in written form, but we are assured that Mr. Pompeo’s engagement with the North Koreans have been very, very clear on what complete denuclearization means and how to get from here to complete denuclearization, which means the complete dismantlement of the weapons, the materials, the facilities, the plans. This is a very clearly-set goal for North Korea, and we expect them to deliver on this commitment to complete denuclearization.


	On the abduction issue, yes, my president has also raised this in two rounds of discussions with Chairman Kim, and we urge them to engage in bilateral discussions with Japan on this issue. After all, it’s a bilateral issue. We also have a couple of our nationals detained in North Korea, so it’s an issue that concerns us as well.


	Thank you.


SECRETARY POMPEO: I think my two colleagues answered your first question very clearly. There is no difference. But most importantly is what the North Koreans understand. We had lengthy discussions about the scope of what complete denuclearization means over the past two days. They acknowledge that this is broad; this is, as my two colleagues have said, from weapons systems to fissile material to the production facilities, enrichment facilities, across the range of weapons and missiles. It’s a broad definition of denuclearization. The North Koreans understand that and have not challenged that.


	Second, they also understand that denuclearization makes no sense absent verification, and they acknowledge that as well. There will be a verification connected to the complete denuclearization. It’s what President Trump and Chairman Kim both agreed to. And so folks can try and parse words should they choose to do so. What’s most important is what the North Koreans understand and the demands that the world is making of North Korea, and there can be – it’s unmistakable, the scope of what denuclearization means to the North Koreans. I’ve been very clear with them.


	Second, I did raise the issue of the abduction of Japanese. I’ve done it at each conversation I’ve had with my North Korean counterparts, whether it was on my first two trips with Chairman Kim or on this trip with Kim Yong-chul. I’ve raised it repeatedly. I won’t go into any of the details about particular parts of that element of our discussion. Know that it is important to the United States; it’s part of our discussions each and every time we interact with our North Korean counterparts.


MODERATOR: Second question. Gentleman in front of the microphone, please.


QUESTION: Hi, Mr. Secretary. Thank you very much for hosting this. I’m David Clark from Agence France-Presse, AFP. Following your talks yesterday, Mr. Secretary, the North Koreans issued a statement in which they described your demands as gangster-like and insisted that there be a series of political and economic concessions hand-in-hand with the progress towards denuclearization. You have said that maximum pressure will continue until this denuclearization, as you define it, is complete.


	Is there any scope for concessions en route, or will they simply have to accept denuclearization before you can move towards sanctions relief and political settlement of the Korean War and so forth, the other demands that they have? Thank you.


SECRETARY POMPEO: So --


QUESTION: Oh, and given what they’ve said, how can you continue to say that you believe they are negotiating in good faith?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Because they were. And they did. It’s pretty simple. So look, people are going to make certain comments after meetings. If I paid attention to what the press said, I’d go nuts, and I refuse to do that. I am determined to achieve the commitment that President Trump made, and I am counting on Chairman Kim to be determined to follow through on the commitment that he made. And so if those requests were gangster-like, they are – the world is a gangster, because there was a unanimous decision at the UN Security Council about what needs to be achieved.


	The second point, as we move forward, we have been very clear there were three parts of the agreement in the Singapore summit. There were the establishment of peaceful relations between the countries, increased security assurances to North Korea and its people, and finally, denuclearization. Each of those needs to be conducted in parallel. We need to work on those efforts simultaneously. And so it is absolutely the case that there are places where there will be things that take place along the way that help achieve the security assurances that the North Koreans need and improvement in the peaceful relations between our two countries during the time that denuclearization is taking place.


	But the economic sanctions are a different kettle of fish altogether. The economic sanctions and the continued enforcement – so the world will see continued enforcement actions by the United States in the days and weeks ahead, and I’m counting on those other countries that are with me here today and others around the world to continue to enforce these sanctions as well. The enforcement of those sanctions will continue until denuclearization is complete.


MODERATOR: Due to the time constraint, I would like to make the next question the last one. Madam, please.


QUESTION: (Via interpreter) Hello, I am Yoon Seol-Young from JoongAng Daily, JTBC. Secretary Pompeo, you mentioned how you saw many progress in almost all central issues, however North Korea stated that the United States had unilateral position and it expressed regrets for that. Secretary Pompeo, you highlighted FFVD, so I would like to know what reaction North Korea showed to this.


	And we believe that there were also other discussions. So regarding declaration of North Korea’s nuclear missile facilities and stockpiles and also timeline to denuclearization, how much achievement have you achieved?


	And finally, you did not meet Chairman Kim Jong-un this time around. Is there any particular reason for that?


SECRETARY POMPEO: With respect to progress, you again referred to the statements after the event. I was there for the event. I know actually what precisely took place. When we spoke to them about the scope of denuclearization, they did not push back. It wasn’t my language; it was the language of Chairman Kim. He committed to complete denuclearization.


	The commitment that Chairman Kim made is important and powerful, and I am convinced that he understands the commitment he made, and I am hopeful that we will find a path forward to achieve that commitment that Chairman Kim himself made personally to President Trump and then to world in the signed agreement between our two leaders.


	With respect to timeline, we talked about timeline a great deal during our conversations. There’s still much work to do to establish what the precise timeline for the various events will be, and we talked about it in the context of the continued commitment of North Korea to destroy their missile engine test site, a commitment that they reaffirmed yesterday and told us that it would happen at a time that was important. And we told them important would be soon, and I am hopeful that that will take place soon. It will be an important event along the step towards denuclearization. It will be a good step towards fulfilling their goal.


	And then your final question was about the fact that I did not meet with Chairman Kim Jong-un on this trip. It was never anticipated that I would meet with him. We went there to work with Kim Yong-chul and our two teams to work together over the course of two days. We did just that.


MODERATOR: This concludes the joint press conference. Thank you very much.

QUESTION: Mr. Secretary, how did the meetings go?


MS NAUERT: The Secretary has some comments he wants to make first.


SECRETARY POMPEO: So yeah, so let me just – a couple things. We had many hours of productive conversations. These are complicated issues, but we made progress on almost all of the central issues. Some places a great deal of progress, other places there’s still more work to be done.


	We now have a meeting in Panmunjom set up for July 12 – it could move by one day or two – where there will be discussions between the folks responsible for the repatriation of remains, will take place at the border, and that process will begin to develop over the days that follow. So very productive conversation about the process by which we will deliver on the commitments that were made in the Singapore summit.


	The North Koreans also confirmed the missile engine testing facility, we talked about what the modalities would look like for the destruction of that facility as well, and so some progress there as well. And then we have laid out a path for further negotiations at the working level so that the two teams can get together and continue these discussions.


QUESTION: Did you bring up the satellite images that show that the facilities are actually expanding, and what did the North Koreans say when you mentioned that?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Well, your characterization is interesting. We talked about what the North Koreans are continuing to do and how it’s the case we can get our arms around achieving what Chairman Kim and President Trump both agreed to, which was the complete denuclearization of North Korea. There is no – no one walked away from that. They’re still equally committed. Chairman Kim is still committed. I had a chance to speak to President Trump this morning. I know my counterpart spoke with Chairman Kim during the course of our negotiations as well. We had productive, good-faith negotiations.


MS NAUERT: Last question.


QUESTION: Mr. Secretary, are you any closer to a sense of a timeline for denuclearization and a baseline declaration for their weapons of mass destruction?


SECRETARY POMPEO: I’m not going to get into the details of our conversations, but we spent a good deal of time talking about each of those two things, and I think we made progress in every element of our discussions.


QUESTION: What was your one deliverable?


MS NAUERT: We’ve got to go. We’ve got to go.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Thank you, all.

	On behalf of the Government of the United States of America, I congratulate the people of Seychelles on the 42nd anniversary of your independence.


	In just over four decades, your accomplishments in economic growth, environmental protection, and social development have been deeply impressive. Your country’s ability to attract increasing numbers of tourists without harming your unique marine flora and fauna has been an example for the world. Seychelles has played an essential role in preventing Indian Ocean piracy, an especially valuable contribution given your population size and strategic position.


	Since independence, Seychelles has come to be seen by many as a symbol of success in the region. I join you in celebrating the achievements of the past 42 years and wish you success in accomplishing national goals for many decades to come.

SECRETARY POMPEO: Welcome, everyone to the State Department. We are incredibly proud to be hosting this event today.


	I want to thank Ivanka Trump for joining us at this event for the second year in a row now. Your personal engagement with this issue matters an awful lot. It illustrates the administration’s complete commitment to and the priority we place on human trafficking both at home and abroad, so thank you very much for being with us today. Your advocacy matters, and we’ll talk about that today.


	I’m also honored to have Senator Corker. I saw Representative Smith and Representative Donovan. Thank you all for being here and joining us today as well. We know that putting an end to human trafficking is a bipartisan objective. It supersedes any politics here in the United States. Our commitment to fighting and ending this together is incredibly strong.


	I also want to welcome all the ambassadors and representatives from the foreign diplomatic corps present here today. You’re important partners here for this issue as well.


	And none of this happens just with the work of the State Department. We are grateful for the many federal agencies, individuals, nongovernmental organizations, and international organizations who continue to help us better understand the many manifestations of human trafficking and the most effective ways to combat it.


	Finally, we’re thankful for the work of the United States Advisory Council on Human Trafficking. This March, President Trump appointed nine members to this advisory council. Each member is a survivor of human trafficking, representing many different backgrounds, experiences, and it advises the Trump administration on federal anti-trafficking policies and programs.


	The council also serves as a model, one that we hope other governments will consider creating as well. It gives survivors a meaningful seat at the table to help guide the creation of anti-trafficking policies and ensure governments adopt a victim-centered approach to resolving this.


	And today we also have the incredible, extraordinary opportunity to honor 10 individuals who have committed their lives to this effort and often have put their own lives at risk in doing so. The 2018 TIP Report Heroes will be recognized formally in a few minutes, but I wanted to personally thank them and express my admiration for the tremendous, awe-inspiring work that each of you do. To this year’s heroes, we salute you. (Applause.)


	Every year our report focuses on a specific thing. This year’s TIP Report highlights the critical work of local communities to stop traffickers and provide support to victims. Human trafficking is a global problem, but it’s a local one too. Human trafficking can be found in a favorite restaurant, a hotel, downtown, a farm, or in their neighbor’s home.


	I can speak to this personally. When I was a member of Congress from south central Kansas, frankly, under the tutelage of now-Ambassador, then-Governor Brownback, we saw the impact of human trafficking in a place like Wichita, Kansas. I-35 passes through the city to the south, and we saw the impact it had on our community, but more importantly, on the persons being trafficked through our community. It has been important to me since then, and I’m proud to be here today to present this report.


	If we’re going to win this fight, national governments must empower local communities to proactively identify human trafficking and develop local solutions to address it.


	As we have every year, the report also points out which countries are improving efforts – their efforts to tackle the crime and which countries are making it easier to carry it out. I’m glad to say we have several good news – progress to report.


	In Estonia, the government implemented a new law that will help victims come forward and get the support that the victims need to recover.


	The Government of Argentina convicted officials complicit in trafficking crimes, established additional legal protection for victims, and bolstered efforts to train frontline responders.


	In Bahrain, the government worked to hold local traffickers criminally accountable and developed a mechanism to get victims needed shelter.


	The Government of Cyprus bolstered efforts to convict traffickers and improve protections for victims as well.


	We saw some positive movements across entire regions as well. Of the 48 African countries included in the report, 14 received upgrades – meaning we observed a strong trend of increased efforts to improve their overall response. Despite significant security threats, migration challenges, other financial constraints, and other obstacles, the region improved significantly.


	We commend those countries taking action, but we also will never shy away from pointing out countries that need to step up.


	We read the horrific accounts of human trafficking and abuse of African migrants, refugees, and asylum-seekers in Libya, resulting in modern-day slave markets. We’ve engaged the Libyan Government of National Accord to bring the perpetrators to justice, including complicit government officials. We welcome its commitment to doing so and look forward to seeing real action.


	In Southeast Asia, Burma’s armed forces and others in the Rakhine State dislocated hundreds of thousands of Rohingya and members of other ethnic groups, many of whom were exploited through the region as a result. Some in the Burmese military also recruited child soldiers and subjected adults and children from ethnic minority groups to forced labor.


	We see the tragic examples of forced labor in North Korea as well. Untold number of North Korean citizens are subjected to forced labor overseas by their own government, in many cases with the tacit approval of host governments.


	And in Iran, trafficking victims are punished – the victims are punished – for acts they are forced to commit. For example, sex trafficking victims may face the death penalty for committing adultery. This is a horrible perversion of justice by a corrupt regime.


	We take these stories to heart. We use them as fuel to motivate us to action as we work together to end human trafficking once and for all.


	You’ll see from today’s report that there remains a great deal of work left to do. The world should know that we will not stop until human trafficking is a thing of the past.


	Before I conclude, I’d like to thank Acting Director Johnstone for leading the TIP Office over the last year. Thank you, Kari. Thank you for your dedicated and talented staff at the TIP Office. Your long hours and hard work have produced a report that will not go unnoticed. It’s a team and department-wide effort. Thank you to you and your team. (Applause.)


	With that, please join me in welcoming Advisor to the President Ms. Ivanka Trump as we present awards to the 2018 TIP Heroes. (Applause.)


MS JOHNSTONE: Thank you, Mr. Secretary, for your meaningful words and for using your voice for this important issue. And now we will ask each TIP Report Hero to stand up when I call out their name and country and join us to receive their award.


	Mr. Ausamah AlAbsi from Bahrain. (Applause.) In recognition of his perseverance in advocating for victim-centered policies within the government by establishing one of the region’s top shelters for trafficking victims, launching the government’s new national referral mechanism for trafficking victims, and spearheading efforts to reduce the vulnerability of foreign workers by reforming the government sponsorship system.


	And next, Mr. Josue Ango from Burkina Faso. (Applause.) In recognition of his exceptional commitment to fighting human trafficking throughout his career, his key role in building Burkina Faso’s comprehensive and multinational anti-trafficking network, and his invaluable contributions to strengthening the governance response to combating child labor and supporting youth who are vulnerable to human trafficking. (Applause.)


	Francisca Awah Mbuli from Cameroon. (Applause.) In recognition of her unwavering resolve to prevent forced labor within vulnerable communities in Cameroon, her commitment to raising awareness throughout the country and around the world in partnership with media outlets and international organizations, and her innovative programs to economically empower women who are survivors of human trafficking.

(Applause.)


	Blessing Okoedion, from Nigeria. (Applause.) In recognition of her extraordinary courage and using her lived experiences to spread awareness about and prevent human trafficking, her selfless efforts to assist survivors and lend a helping hand to those still subjected to the crime, and her unwavering advocacy for greater protections for vulnerable groups and victims of trafficking across Italy and Nigeria. (Applause.)


	Ivana Radovic, from Serbia. (Applause.) In recognition of her pivotal role in driving the work of one of Serbia’s premier anti-trafficking organizations, her persistent advocacy efforts for trafficking victims, and her unparalleled contributions to strengthening Serbia’s anti-trafficking response by building the capacity of government and private sector institutions. (Applause.)


	Kim Jong-chul, from South Korea. (Applause.) In recognition of his commitment to expose forced labor conditions and practices through his groundbreaking investigative research on human trafficking in South Korea and globally, particularly of migrant fishermen on South Korean flagged vessels, and his tireless work in fighting for the rights of vulnerable groups and human trafficking victims. (Applause.)


	Dr. Yosief Abrham Mehari, from Sudan. (Applause.) In recognition of his selfless service as a medical doctor and advocate to provide critical assistance to trafficking victims, his unparalleled generosity in dedicating his time and resources to ensure survivors receive quality medical care and support, and his collaboration with Sudanese authorities to connect victims of human trafficking with services to help them successfully rebuild their lives. (Applause.)


	And now, I am pleased to introduce TIP Report Hero Francisca Awah Mbuli, a survivor of human trafficking and the founding director of Survivors’ Network in Cameroon. (Applause.) As a survivor of domestic servitude, Ms. Awah Mbuli uses her experience and creativity to raise awareness among communities throughout Cameroon and advocate for better services for trafficking victims. Her organization has built a unique approach to survivor empowerment by focusing on economic independence and fostering entrepreneurship among women and girls. We are honored to have her here with us today to speak on behalf of this year’s Trafficking in Persons Report Heroes.


MS AWAH MBULI: Dear Secretary of State Pompeo and distinguished guests, on behalf of all survivors and TIP Heroes, the recognition you bestow on us is an honor. Thank you, sir. (Applause.)


	The TIP Office is recognized internationally for its leadership in ending the atrocity of slavery. Your highlighting our effort to end human trafficking bolsters our credibility internationally and puts us in a network of freedom fighters around the world.


	A few years ago, I could have only dreamt of such an honor. Three years ago, I accepted a job offer to teach English in the Gulf Cooperation Council. This was after returning home from Norway, where I was pursuing a master’s degree in human rights and multiculturality but couldn’t afford to live there.


	When I arrived the Gulf Cooperation Council, there wasn’t a job teaching English. I was trafficked into slavery as a domestic worker, where I didn’t earn anything but inhuman treatment and sexual abuses. When I said that I wanted to go home, they told me that I had a debt of $3,000 U.S. dollars which I had to pay, and then pay my flight back home. This was a lie.


	However, I considered selling a kidney to pay the $3,000 U.S. dollars and get out. Other girls were in such desperate situations that they went into brothels. Some were never heard from again. All of the women I met on my way to the Gulf Cooperation Council had been promised jobs with higher pay than we could have ever received in our home country. None had received a job or pay they were promised.


	All of us left our homes so that we could find a way to support our families. In many cases we were the hope of our families, the one who was put through college. With the help of an NGO, I was able to escape my captors and return home. Then we helped 27 other women return home. Many others were not as lucky.


	There are limited resources available through international aid. That is why I made it my mission and my organization, Survivors’ Network’s mission, to build a grassroot movement in Africa to create an awareness program to prevent human trafficking. My sisters and brothers need to learn the signs of false work promises. To prevent trafficking, people need vocational training to build skills so that they can work and become self-sufficient in their home countries.


	Microfinance can help those who have skills start businesses, however even more than that is necessary. There is need to be social and economic empowerment education so that men cannot control women’s futures. Perhaps a great example of one way that anti-trafficking organizations have historically impacted many women’s self-sufficiency.


	When it comes to communities, awareness campaigns about human trafficking and modern-day slavery can help to educate and protect people of all ages. Grassroot activities in towns, schools, churches, bus stops, radio and television stations, on the internet and social media, all contribute to awareness and increase the possibility that a bystander will intervene or an abuser will think twice.


	This in no way diminishes the importance of rescuing and caring for the 25 million people who are currently enslaved. It is especially important that once victims are rescued they have a supportive network and infrastructure that they can lean on to prevent being re-trafficked.


	Thank you for supporting me and my fellow TIP Report Heroes in our mission. This recognition means so much to all of us and revalidates our efforts and amplify our abilities to fight this terrible crime. Despite being named heroes, not just us but anyone can and should get involved in fighting human trafficking. We can all talk about this issue in our schools and workplaces and over dinner with our families. The more people who know and care, the more people we will save.


	We are just beginning the anti-trafficking movement in Cameroon. But I know that together, we can end modern-day slavery.


	Thank you. Thank you, everyone. (Applause.)


MS JOHNSTONE: Thank you, Francisca, for your inspiring remarks. We have a lot to learn from your journey. Your strength and perseverance go a long way toward ensuring that others can live a life filled with promise.


	It is both an honor and a humbling experience to share this platform with so many human rights defenders who are undaunted in their search for freedom. I am thrilled that these heroes will have the opportunity to share their insights beyond the State Department halls when they meet with local leaders and organizations. Connecting leaders, experts, and activists from communities around the world to exchange stories, promising practices, and lessons learned advances our global fight against human trafficking.


	We believe so strongly in collaboration and partnership, especially at the state and local level, that we focused this year’s TIP Report introduction around this theme. My team and I have learned that some of the most innovative ideas, strategies and solutions come from grassroots organizations, whether in the United States or abroad. We have seen again and again that individuals make the difference. Whether this is the Sacramento Uber driver who overheard a conversation between a teenage passenger and her traffickers and called the police, or the Chicago restaurant manager who noticed two employees with identical burns on their faces and encouraged them to contact the police, who charged their landlord with forced labor.


	Last year, I was moved to see traditional leaders and elders in Ghana working with volunteers and social workers to develop a proactive community approach to combating human trafficking. The collective works of these individuals and others like them helped remove more than 180 children from forced labor, and it prevented numerous others from suffering such exploitation. Whether a good Samaritan, local leader or someone who’s made anti-trafficking their life’s work, individual actions matter.


	At the State Department, we are committed to partnering with a broad range of stakeholders so that together, we may better prevent the crime from occurring, hold traffickers to account, and assist survivors of trafficking through a victim-centered and trauma-informed approach. Let us all draw inspiration from all of these heroes on the stage today, and from those doing what they can in their communities and around the world to fight trafficking. While the magnitude of the crime and myriad challenges may sometimes seem daunting, we must all roll up our sleeves and work together to break the bonds of modern slavery. Collectively, let us ensure that justice and freedom prevail.


	Thank you all for coming today. Please remain in your seats until the Secretary, Ms. Trump and our heroes have left, and then I welcome you all to stay for a few minutes and mingle, and then exit out toward the back where you can pick up your own personal copy of the 2018 Trafficking in Persons Report. Thank you so much. (Applause.)

SECRETARY POMPEO: Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman, Senator Leahy.


	I appreciate you having me here today. I look forward to our conversation. Distinguished members of the subcommittee, I appreciate the opportunity to talk today about the President’s Budget and the issues that are on your mind. The lists that you show there, Senator Graham, are long, and I could probably add a couple others. I’m sure you could add a couple more as well.


	And I want you to know too how much I appreciate the fact that you all have operated in a bipartisan manner. I’ve had a chance to talk to many of you on the phone. We’ve had productive conversations over a wide range of topics. Know that I am always available to listen and make sure I understand your priorities and the way you are thinking about the world. It is helpful to me. It’s not just something I do as a courtesy but something that I value extraordinarily.


	You all were very short with your opening statements. I will do the same.


	You should see that the overall proposed budget will reflect an effort to manage dollars wisely. We’ve already made substantial progress in working on next year’s budget. I look forward to each of us and our teams continuing to work to achieve America’s foreign policy objectives.


	And with that, I have a written statement and I’m happy – I’ve submitted it, and I’m happy to close there and take questions.

	The Iranian government is squandering its citizens’ resources, whether its adventurism in Syria, its support for Hizbollah, Hamas, and the Houthis, or its ambitions for wastefully expanding its nuclear program, it will only add to the suffering of the people of Iran. As I have said before, it should surprise no one that protests continue in Iran. The Iranian people are demanding their leaders share the country’s wealth and respond to their legitimate needs. We condemn the government’s same futile tactics of suppression, imprisonment of protestors, and the denial of Iranians’ frustrations. The people of Iran are tired of the corruption, injustice, and incompetence from their leaders. The world hears their voice.

MS NAUERT: So, Elise, we have 10 minutes, so I’ll just stand by.


QUESTION: Okay, okay. Mr. Secretary, two months ago you inherited a State Department essentially on its knees really – low morale, the staff had really been depleted – and you promised to bring the swagger back. So I’m interested in your view. How have things changed, do you think, since you took over?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Well, we’re two months in and we have made a significant amount of progress in doing a couple things. First, we’re reducing the amount of command and control; that is, I have allowed officers to make decisions. We’ve moved many decisions out of the seventh floor back to the professionals in the work force, just as I described what I would do – allowing the experts to make the judgments, understanding the President’s direction and understanding my guidance so that they know commander’s intent. And I think that’s made a real difference not only in our ability to execute the President’s vision but do so in a way that moves at the speed of our adversaries.


	Second, we’ve made a real push to get the team staffed up as well. I’ve conducted a couple of swearing-ins myself both for a big group of Civil Service officers as well as some swearing-ins for some seniors. We’re making progress on Capitol Hill too, and in the coming weeks we expect we’ll have a whole much more handful of under secretaries, assistant secretaries that’ll get pushed through. So real progress on getting the team back on the field as well.


	And all in all, we’ve also had some opportunities to be at the front of policy making. We did great work – the team was fantastic – in Singapore helping the President execute that mission. I’d say the same about the work that we’re doing in the preparation for the NATO summit. All the kinds of things that get the team excited about doing what it is they came to the State Department to do.


QUESTION: Let’s talk a little bit about North Korea. In the statement, Kim Jong-un at the summit agreed to some very broad principles on denuclearization. Secretary Mattis, for instance, said he hasn’t seen any visible signs of steps yet. Have you been able to put more meat on the bones with specifics about what the North Koreans are willing to do and when?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Forty years of history, and now 12 days of an agreement, and – but I will say – I will say this. There are understandings that had been put together prior to the summit, some that took place while the President was there in Singapore, that have, I think, put us on the right trajectory so that we can build out a framework for success.


	But none of that can happen, none of that framework can be filled out, absent the two primary decision makers – in North Korea, the decision maker making clear his intent to denuclearize. I heard it myself when I visited there as CIA director, I heard it myself when I visited Pyongyang as Secretary of State, and I heard it again when there was a group together with the President and Chairman Kim. He has been unequivocal in his statement that he’s prepared to do this. We’ve seen for the first time them talk about that inside of North Korea.


	There always will be challenges, and there’s work to do. But none of this could have happened without the commitment of the two most senior leaders, and so long as that commitment stays in place, the United States is prepared to do exactly what the President said: Create a brighter future for North Korea and provide security assurances for the North Korean people.


QUESTION: But I mean, you yourself said obviously it’s the beginning of a process, and clearly Kim Jong-un had to make those declarations. But you’ve said that your patience, the U.S. patience, can’t be infinite on this. So I’m – have you given yourself any kind of – I don’t want to use the word timeline, but how long can you give to test the actual seriousness of those commitments? I’ve heard maybe you’d like to try and get something on the table by the end of the summer, just to proceed or know that maybe it’s time to reassess how you look at it?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Well, Elise, we’ll constantly reassess. That’s an ongoing process. And we’ll – we hope that we will have an ongoing process of making progress. But look, the President was clear. Each of the actions that we’ve taken – his decision to suspend the high-level war games – exists only so long as there is good-faith negotiation progress, productive results being achieved. If we can’t do that, if it turns out that there’s just – there’s no – there’s no capacity to deliver the outcome that both presidents said they wanted – yeah, we’ll reassess whether that’s – I’m not going to put a timeline on it. But whether that’s in two months or six months, we’re committed to moving forward in an expeditious manner to see if we can achieve what it is the two leaders set out to do.


QUESTION: You have this NATO summit, the President’s trip to the UK in a few weeks. It’s on the heels of the President imposing these tariffs. And I mean, he’s used some pretty incendiary language, I think, to describe some of our closest allies, and now you hear the Europeans and Canada say that they just don’t think they could count on the U.S. And that’s got to make your job harder now in advancing some of your top policy goals when your friends aren’t with you. How are you going to mend these kind of rifts in the transatlantic alliance?


SECRETARY POMPEO: I was a young soldier in Germany in the 1980s. I remember some of the same conversation – oh goodness, the European partners are concerned about something that the United States is doing. I say all of that, right? We were going to put missiles in, we were going to take missiles out – I could go on. I could go on for hours about places where the United States and Europe have had issues where they disagreed.


	I set that up by way of background because the things that you mentioned are in line with the kinds of discussions that America and Europe have had for decades. In this instance we’re trying to make sure that the European partners share their fair burden of building out the critical alliance with NATO. We’re trying to make sure that the trade arrangements between our countries are fair and reciprocal and balanced.


	But every conversation – and I have conversations with great frequency – I spoke with Chrystia Freeland within the last 30 hours. I spoke with the foreign minister of France yesterday morning as well, and I’m sure I’ll speak with Boris sometime this week. Every conversation we have is aimed at achieving a shared set of objectives. The rift between the United States and Europe is much overstated. There are so many things where we share common values and common concerns. I am confident that we will work to achieve the goals that the President has laid out and these things that are presenting challenges today; but in the end the traditional values-driven alliance between Europe and the United States, that transatlantic alliance, will remain strong, as it has for coming on 70-plus years now.


QUESTION: Mr. Secretary, the President is soon going to meet with President Putin. The last time they met, Putin said that Russia didn’t meddle in the election, and Director of National Intelligence Coats said that he thinks though they still are. And with the midterm just a few months away, does this have to – doesn’t this have to be an important agenda item at this – at this upcoming meeting?


SECRETARY POMPEO: There’s lots to talk about between the United States and Russia. As you know, Ambassador Bolton is headed that way now. I’ve spoken with my counterpart, Sergey Lavrov, a couple of times in these first couple months, whether it’s the battlefield in Syria, the situation in Ukraine, Russian active measures. There are many topics that I’m sure President Trump and President Putin will discuss, and each of them is important to trying to put the relationship back in a place where there are a common set of understandings. The Russians, unlike the Europeans, don’t share our value set. It is a different conversation, but it is still a conversation that’s worth having.


QUESTION: But don’t – I mean, that aside, and obviously there are a lot of areas that you do work together, but don’t you – do you think this is the issue that’s preventing those warming of ties, really – the mistrust?


SECRETARY POMPEO: I mean, they killed someone in Britain. I could go on. To say that there’s a single issue that’s caused there to not be a warm relationship between the two countries, I think, would be a misnomer. But make no mistake; I think President Trump agrees the Russian interfering – Russians interfering in our election – is something that they simply cannot do. I don’t think – I don’t think he’d take any umbrage with that.


QUESTION: I have just a couple more questions, Mr. Secretary.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Of course.


QUESTION: Since the U.S. pulled out of the Iran deal, the JCPOA, we’ve seen new designations, you’ve sent the State Department officials and Treasury officials out to discuss next steps, and you’ve been very vocal yourself about Iran, including the threat from the IRGC. Do you think a possible next step could be designating them as a foreign terrorist group? There’s some talk in the administration that this should be a next step.


SECRETARY POMPEO: There are a bunch of next steps. I don’t want to get out in front of the decision-making process of the President. But the --


QUESTION: That’s on the table, though, isn’t it?


SECRETARY POMPEO: There are lots of – there’s lot of things that are being discussed, things that will prove, we believe, very effective at the end goal – which is, at the end of the day, what matters, right? Right.


	And the end goal is to convince the Islamic Republic of Iran to be a normal country. It’s pretty simple. It’s been funny; everybody’s talked about these 12 things that I demanded of Iran. They are no different from what I demand of Belgium, right? They’re no different than what we demand of – pick a country – of Singapore, right?


	Be a normal country. Don’t conduct terrorism, don’t launch missiles into international airports, don’t be the world’s largest state sponsor of terror, comport with nuclear requirements. None of these are things that are difficult or somehow singling out Iran; but rather, we’re asking them to do the things that nations that are part of the community of nations do so that they can behave in normal commerce, normal diplomatic relationships, all of the things that we’re looking for. It’s pretty straightforward. And a particular designation that we make or a particular operational tactic that we undertake, I’m not going to talk about those tonight.


QUESTION: Understood. I’ll just end on the immigration crisis that’s playing out. You’ve seen these images of the family separations, some reports that parents are being sent with other kids. It’s prompting a lot of outcries around the world. And I’m wondering: How concerned are you about the stain this might be placing on the U.S. image and, when placed kind of alongside the tariff issue, concerns that there’s this perception the U.S. is protectionist, closing up shop?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Yeah. I have the amazing blessing of being the foreign minister for the most generous nation in the history of civilization; and that goes for trade issues, that goes for the acceptance of refugees; it goes for our deep history of humanitarian assistance, whether that’s reconstruction money or people on the ground. I am not at all concerned that anyone in the world could look at the United States but understand it to be anything but a beacon of hope, of democracy, and freedom. We have a long history of that. and it has continued under the Trump administration.


QUESTION: Mr. Secretary, just to finish --


MS NAUERT: Elise, we’ve got to go.


QUESTION: Just to finish, one last question, please.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Yes, ma’am.


QUESTION: Thank you so much, Mr. Secretary.


	Just to follow on that, your department has had travel advisories from some of these countries. Last year, you know that there was that State Department report about the need to tackle the root causes and the real drivers of illegal immigration, and such as poverty, violence, and crime. These are some of the most dangerous countries that these people are coming from, and is there any thought to making a more concerted effort to demonstrate U.S. leadership to deal with some of these underlying conditions that might be a better deterrent to counter some of these images?


SECRETARY POMPEO: There’s multiple prongs to the Trump administration’s effort along the lines that you describe, and yes, we are at the State Department, who has a part of this, doing our best to work with the Northern Triangle countries to create conditions on the ground such that they won’t make this long, arduous, and ultimately often perilous trek up and through Mexico to attempt to get into the United States. We do think that’s important. But we’ve done a lot of work with those Central American countries to address that irregular immigration, and there’s always more that can be done, and we’re working hard at it.


MS NAUERT: Elise, we’ve got to go.


QUESTION: Got it. Mr. Secretary --


SECRETARY POMPEO: Elise, thank you.


QUESTION: Thank you. Thanks for taking the time and hope to see you soon.

",Interview With Elise Labott of CNN,http://www.state.gov/secretary/remarks/2018/06/283504.htm
"June 22, 2018","
QUESTION: Secretary Pompeo, thank you for having us.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Hugh, it’s great to be with you. Welcome to the State Department.


QUESTION: Let me start practical. Great to be here. Let me be practical: You’ve got some empty offices at the Department of State. Is the Senate working with you to fill them so you can have the leadership in place for the best diplomatic corps in the world?


SECRETARY POMPEO: So the answer is we need to move faster here. Everyone in the process needs to. We’ve got to get our diplomats out to every corner of the world and do that as expeditiously as possible. It is the case when I took over there were some big gaps in important places. We’ll soon have our ambassador in place in South Korea and some of the places that are absolutely most essential. But we need everyone helping, and I am confident that Senators Menendez and Corker will help me achieve that.


QUESTION: How about the leader? You talk to Leader McConnell about this as well?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Yeah. He’s fully on board. He’s moving our folks through as quickly as he can. We may get a couple extra weeks in August where we’ll have some opportunity to get some additional people out there doing what the President wants, right? – leading to deliver his foreign policy in every corner of the world.


QUESTION: You’re a former congressman. You can’t envy your Senate colleagues staying here in August, do you?


SECRETARY POMPEO: It’ll be warm, but I’ll be here right alongside them.


QUESTION: All right.


SECRETARY POMPEO: So will our diplomats.


QUESTION: Let’s go geopolitical. Forty years ago, Alexandr Solzhenitsyn this month talked about a world split apart and the Soviet Union. Seventy-one years ago, another Army guy, George Marshall, gave the Marshall Plan. Both of them were talking about the Soviet Union. Is it time to reorient to our near-peer or peer-competitor being Russia – or then the Soviet Union – to the PRC now? Are they number one in our competitive environment?


SECRETARY POMPEO: I think they do pose the most serious threat and, frankly, an opportunity for America if we can get it right. If you compare and contrast the two as between not the Soviet Union, but Russia, and China, we’ve got one that has wealth and resources, and the other that is a power that is struggling mightily.


	We need to make sure we understand what China is doing. The President has been very clear about the risk to America associated with their willingness to steal our property, our intellectual property and otherwise. Eyes wide open with respect to Russia’s efforts in the South China Sea and around the world to build out a much bigger, stronger, tougher country. There’s things we clearly need to do alongside them and where we have shared interests, but where we don’t, we need to make sure America is properly positioned to speak to them about each of our two countries’ respective roles within the world.


QUESTION: When you sat down with President Xi not long ago, was that cordial? Was it friendly? He gets along so well with President Trump. You’re the diplomat, maybe the bad cop to President Trump’s good cop. How did it go?


SECRETARY POMPEO: It went great. It was very kind of him to visit with me. It was late one evening. I was returning to the United States but wanted to make sure and stop in. China will have an important role to play as we work our way through the challenging issue of denuclearizing North Korea, and I wanted to make sure and explain to them the conversations that the President had had with Chairman Kim, to make sure they understood what it was we needed from them, which at this point is to continue to make sure that the economic sanctions that are in place remain in place. And then we had a handful of other issues that I wanted to speak with President Xi about. It was a good, warm, cordial meeting. I think we both expressed our views, and I appreciated him taking time to meet with the Secretary of State from the United States.


QUESTION: When you think of him, he’s now president for as long as we can see – you think Mao and Deng. Are we talking about 20, 25 years with President Xi, and do the American people full grasp what a significant player he is now, not just for this year but for the next decade or two?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Yeah, it’s undoubtedly the case. He has consolidated power in a way that his immediate predecessors had not, in a way that’s truly historic. And the United States and the other countries in the region as well need to recognize that. I think some are waking up to it in ways that they may not have two or five years ago. We all need to acknowledge what China presents in terms of both opportunity and challenge.


QUESTION: In 1972 President Nixon sort of flipped the script on the Soviet Union by going to see Mao, even though Mao had been the greater murderer in the 20th century. Is it possible that you and the President are working to flip the script again and perhaps make nice with Russia because China represents to the United States a bigger competitor?


SECRETARY POMPEO: The President’s been unambiguous since he took office that there are places where Russia is working against the United States but many places where we work together. I had a chance to do that in my previous role as CIA director, where we worked with the Russians on counterterrorism issues, where the two nations had shared interests. And so we are having conversations with our Russian counterparts trying to find places where we have overlapping interests but protecting American interests where we do not.


QUESTION: Are you going to go to Moscow this summer?


SECRETARY POMPEO: I don’t know if I’ll be heading to Moscow. I’ll meet with my Russian counterpart somewhere, I’m sure. I’ve spoken to Sergey Lavrov a couple of times already as the Secretary of State. Good conversations, each of us expressing our displeasure with each other for various things, all the while making sure that the things that matter most to America, right – you can’t mess around in American elections. Some of the behaviors that they’re undertaking in places like Syria and Ukraine are just – they’re not helpful, they’re not constructive towards the values that the Americans hold dear. And those places we’ll continue to work to make sure they know our interests and our concerns. And then where there’s places we can find common ground, we’ll certainly try --


QUESTION: Should we be surprised if President Trump is in Moscow this summer?


SECRETARY POMPEO: I don’t know what the President’s schedule is going to be. I know Ambassador Bolton’s planning to travel to Moscow on Sunday or Monday. He’ll be meeting with his counterpart, and I think it’s likely that President Trump will be meeting with his counterpart in the not-too-distant future following that meeting.


QUESTION: Interesting. Let me ask about President Xi. What is his role vis-a-vis Chairman Un and the deal? Does he have a veto over what North Korea is doing with you in your conversations?


SECRETARY POMPEO: The conversations between the United States and North Korea have been bilateral talks, just the two of us. We are working to strike a deal, a deal that Chairman Kim has signed up for, where there will be a bargain where he will fully denuclearize, he will permit us to verify that complete denuclearization, and in exchange for that we’ll provide security assurances.


	You know the story well. For decades the North Korean leadership – Chairman Kim, his father and grandfather alike – believed the nuclear program was their security out; it provided them with regime stability and security. And we’ve now flipped that narrative. I believe we have convinced him that that nuclear program, in fact, presents a threat to him and that giving up that program is the path towards a brighter future for the North Korean people.


QUESTION: What is he like, Mr. Secretary, when the cameras aren’t on and the door is closed? When you first went to Pyongyang, what was – what – does he have a sense of humor? Did he joke with you?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Yeah, he does have a sense of humor. He’s conversant in things Western, so he’s paying close attention to what takes place. I’m confident he’ll be watching this show. He’s watching things that Americans are saying. He’s looking to determine if, in fact, America is serious about this.


	If he does this, if he takes this step and reorients, sets a new strategic direction for North Korea where they focus on the economy and their people as opposed to their war-making machine – if you make it that strategic change, does he have a reliable partner in America who will behave the way that President Trump committed that we would when they met in Singapore?


	So he’s bright. He knows the file. He knows the topic very, very well. He’s not turning to others for guidance. It is Chairman Kim who was clearly articulating what you heard him say when he was in Singapore, that he is prepared to fully denuclearize.


QUESTION: Secretary Pompeo, when you sit down with someone like Chairman Kim or President Xi, you’re sitting down with people who have human rights records which are awful. But FDR sat down with Stalin, and Nixon with Mao, and President Reagan with Gorbachev. What’s in your mind when you’re going through with someone who you know the body count is high but with whom we have to deal?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Yeah, we know the histories. This administration has been very clear about defending human rights. Everywhere we go we talk about it, when we meet with countries that aren’t complying with human rights in the way we would want, that aren’t consistent with our value sets. We’ve done that with Chairman Kim. I know the President has spoken about that with Xi as well.


	But you have to remember those human rights challenges existed long before this administration came in, when our policies with respect to those countries were very different; that is, previous efforts to improve on those human rights conditions had failed. We are confident that the biggest threat to the United States, Chairman Kim’s nuclear program, is the place we need to begin. And if we are successful, if we can get the outcome we hope to have, we think we create a greater probability that human rights conditions not only in North Korea but around the world may well improve.


QUESTION: Are there signed protocols to the Singapore summit communique that we don’t know about?


SECRETARY POMPEO: I just don’t want to get into the details of the negotiations that took place before, in Singapore, and have continued since then. I think it is fair to say that there are a number of things, a number of principles that have been agreed to, that I think both parties understand, red lines, things that we – neither country is prepared to go past that give us an opportunity to believe that we really might, for the first time – this is not the first rodeo negotiating with North Korea – that perhaps this time is different.


	We know, too, we could be wrong, and the President has said this very clearly. If this isn’t – if it’s the case that Chairman Kim either is unable to or unprepared to denuclearize, sanctions will remain in place, the enforcement of those sanctions will continue, and we’ll be back hard at it if the negotiations prove to be either not in good faith or unproductive.


QUESTION: Back to President Xi for one or two more questions. We always worry about our friends in Taiwan. Do you believe President Xi, who gave this two-and-a-half-hour, three-hour speech when he became President for life in China, do you think he’s ruled out force vis-a-vis Taiwan, and is the United States standing by its historic agreements with Taiwan vis-a-vis their defense?


SECRETARY POMPEO: We are. President Trump’s had no change in his policy with respect to China. The “one China” policy, the three communiques which followed that, will remain in place. Know the President has spoken with Xi about this on numerous occasions. We have told him that that’s the path forward, a nonviolent path is the right path forward, and I think each of our two countries understand each other’s positions very clearly there.


QUESTION: Speaking about the use of force, let’s turn to Iran, probably the greatest exporter of violence in the world on a daily basis (inaudible). Do you foresee having to use force if they continue on a nuclear path?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Boy, I sure hope not. I hope the ayatollah and Soleimani, the prime drivers of Iranian threat posture, I hope they recognize that whatever decision other countries make about staying in the JCPOA or however they proceed, I hope he – they understand that if they begin to ramp up their nuclear program, the wrath of the entire world will fall upon them. And so it is not in their practical best interest to begin that.


	Whatever happens to the JCPOA, I think the Iranians understand that. It would be – wholly separate from whether they spin a couple of extra centrifuges, if they began to move towards a weapons program, this would be something the entire world would find unacceptable, and we’d end up down a path that I don’t think this is the best interest of Iran, other actors in the Middle East, or indeed the world.


QUESTION: When you say “the wrath of the entire world,” I think of the new entente – and I am talking then for the benefit of the audience – not just of Israel, but of Bahrain, of Egypt, of Jordan and Iraq or Saudi Arabia. The United Arab Emirates are great friends in the Middle East. Would they support that wrath descending on Iran in the form of American military action if they move this way?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Yeah, when I say “wrath,” don’t confuse that for military action. Those are – when I say “wrath,” I mean the moral opprobrium and economic power that fell upon them. That’s what I’m speaking to. I’m not talking to military action here. Just I truly hope that’s never the case. It’s not in anyone’s best interest for that. But make no mistake, President Trump has been very clear: Iran will not get a nuclear weapon nor start its weapons program on this President’s watch.


	And I’ve heard some say that we’ve separated from our allies on this issue of Iran. I don’t think that’s the case. When I talk to my Arab friends, the Israelis, all of those in the region, they are right alongside us. And even when I speak to the Europeans, with whom we have a difference about the JCPOA, they too understand the threat that Iran presents, whether it’s malign activity with Hizballah or in Yemen or in Syria or in Iraq, or its missile program that is launching missiles into airports that Westerners travel through. There is a unified understanding of Iran’s malevolent behavior, and it will be an incredibly united world should Iran choose to head down a nuclear weapons path.


QUESTION: You mentioned General Soleimani. They only understand force sometimes. They are trying to move into Syria where they have put the Revolutionary Guard and the Qods Force again, but you’re saying – I want to just understand – if necessary, the United States is prepared to do whatever it has to do to stop them from having a nuclear weapon.


SECRETARY POMPEO: President Trump’s been unambiguous about – in his statements that says that Iran will not be able to obtain a nuclear weapon.


QUESTION: Now --


SECRETARY POMPEO: Remember too, Hugh, it’s important to remind your viewers the previous agreement permitted them to continue to enrich uranium, all right? We cut a tougher deal on our allies, the Emiratis, than we did on the Iranians with respect to nuclear power. I laid down a dozen items that we’re asking Iran to do. If your viewers go look at them, they’re all simple things.


	They are simply saying become a member of the community of nations, right? Stop launching missiles into non-hostile nations, cease support of terrorism around the world, don’t go down the path of a nuclear weapons system. The asks from the United States in order for Iran to return to the community of nations are all we ask of other countries around the world to be part of the international system.


QUESTION: Anyone who follows your Twitter feed – and I do follow it, Secretary Pompeo – knows that in the last two weeks you’ve done more democracy support in Iran than happened during the Green Revolution under the previous administration. Is that going to be a mark of the Secretary Pompeo years at State, that you’re just going to support the democratic movement in Iran?


SECRETARY POMPEO: I think it’s a mark of President Trump and our administration. We are very hopeful that there will be an increase in the democratic values, and the capacity for Iranians to speak their mind inside the Islamic Republic of Iran.


QUESTION: Let me switch, finally, to the question of how diplomacy has changed. You used to be able to count armies or missiles or an airplane; now, the weapons are not visible. You used to see them at Langley in your time as director of CIA. How do we know who’s got the weapons in the world of cyber, and how are you working with Secretary Mattis to assess and use diplomacy vis-a-vis those weapons?


SECRETARY POMPEO: So that’s a great question, Hugh. The range of instrumentalities of the – the scope of the battlefield has changed with the advent of cyber activity. The good news is as the United States is unrivaled in our capacity to identify bad behaviors – doesn’t mean we pick them all up, doesn’t mean we can’t be misled – but we have incredibly capable cyber teams spread throughout the United States Government, both in the Department of Defense and elsewhere who are watching. They’re watching what folks are doing around the world in cyber space. We have the capacity to respond.


	As a diplomat, one of the fundamental things that Secretary Mattis both agree on is that a cyber attack does not necessarily need to be responded through – only through a cyber means. That is if they engage in something that approaches or becomes a true act of war, then the response is that the United States need to take – aren’t limited just to a cyber response. There will be times when the United States Government decides that’s the most appropriate place, because you can in fact do it quietly. You can respond in the cyber world by sending a message that the entire world doesn’t necessarily see, but your adversary may well see. But there are also times when responses in cyber space will call for diplomatic response or other types of responses from our government.


QUESTION: A couple of last questions: Does the public need to know when we’ve been attacked? We just found out this week in hearings that we were told to stand down during the Russian interference in the election – our forces. Does the public need to know that we’re doing things when we do them in order to calibrate how to judge the President and your responses and Secretary Mattis’s responses?


SECRETARY POMPEO: It’s a difficult challenge to figure out precisely – in the same way the Intelligence Community has things that we don’t share because they work against American interests when we do, or the Department of Defense conducts activities that they want to do in a way that’s quiet, that maybe our adversaries only know and we can protect American interest by protecting American secrets. It’s a complicated calculation to make in each and every instance about how much to disclose and the timing of those disclosures.


	However, when it comes to U.S. domestic issues as it was in that case, I do think there is a thumb on the scale for disclosure. That is – I was speaking more about things that happened internationally around the security realm. When it comes to our elections and U.S. democracy, I definitely think there’s a thumb on the scale with respect to sharing with the American people the threats that are around them.


QUESTION: Secretary Mike Pompeo, thanks for having us for today’s program.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Thank you very much. It’s wonderful to be with you.

SECRETARY POMPEO: Well, good morning, everyone. I’m not going to do all 31 flavors for you as they’re not in my prepared remarks. Frankly, I learned a lot actually from that job working scooping ice cream, things that you all know, right, work hard, tell the truth, perform to your level best at every moment, and often that will lead to good things in your life and in the life of the team that you’re a part of or the business that you’re working to help succeed.


	Thanks to Secretary Ross for the very kind introduction. Thank you to all of you, the international investors who have traveled so far to come here and be part of this, as well as the friends that we have here today from the American business community.


	Thank you, too, to all the governors and our state-level representatives who have joined us from all across the United States. It has truly made this event special.


	And as Wilbur said, I was a congressman, I was the director of the Central Intelligence Agency, but I still consider myself at heart a manufacturing guy. For a decade and a half I ran two manufacturing companies in Wichita, Kansas. The first aerospace manufacturing business was a machine shop. We welded. We had mills and lathes. We sold to Boeing and Lockheed and to Cessna and Raytheon and Gulfstream, and all the airframe manufacturers all across the world. Grew that business to over a $100-million-a-year company.


	And then I was hired to run a company that was similar but serving the oil patch where our customers were companies like Halliburton and Schlumberger and some of the big oilfield producers. Every minute of the time that I was in business, my companies benefited from international cooperation.


	We direct – we benefited directly from foreign direct investment that supports jobs like we had in Wichita, Kansas that now total over 7 million here in the United States. It’s good for America, it’s good for American workers, it’s good for the investors as well.


	So you all are asking why the Secretary of State is here today. You heard from the Secretary of Treasury and Secretary of Commerce. But you must know that global business depends on successful international relationships. You’re looking for the places where you can find the best talent, the most capable people, who has the most transparency, the rule of law, which private sector places have the greatest global brand exposure, and ultimately where can I get the best ROI for the investments that I’ll make.


	It won’t surprise you that I believe deeply and I believe that I can prove here this morning that that’s the United States of America. (Applause.) Not only is it our country, but this is the perfect time. It’s the perfect time to come here as an investor, bring your business and your people here.


	First, we have an enormous number of advantages. I saw this firsthand when I ran two small businesses. We have an incredible culture of entrepreneurship and innovation. We have the world’s largest market for goods and services. We have enormous political stability and a rule of law that is unrivaled. And we have world-class colleges and universities and technology centers. And we have, along with our international partners, developed a financial system and an economic model that is driven by the private sector.


	These assets have been the lifeblood of America for many years. And President Trump’s policies – his economic policies have made our advantages even more of a force multiplier for prosperity. There’s a myth of American retreat from the world, and I have to tell you it is just a myth. President Trump’s agenda is the most pro-business, most pro-international trade of any president in history. It’s been a game-changer for the American economic landscape, and it is one that your company will want to be a part of.


	We can see the benefits in lower personal and corporate tax rates, the enormous number of reduced regulations – one of the things that when I was a small business owner was most difficult for us to compete with, when U.S. economic regulations burdened us – our embrace of domestic energy production that I know Secretary Perry has spoken to, and clear support from an administration that is truly open for business. As Larry Kudlow said earlier this month, “The war against business is over” here in America. “The war against success is over [and] the war against energy is over.” (Applause.)


	Confident employers ready to pay well, the lowest unemployment rates across – rates against all demographics, these are dividends of new policies and a changed attitude creating a new renaissance of American and global prosperity.


	As a result of the President’s policies, international companies and investors are already coming here full speed. You’ll want to make sure you get here at the front of the gold rush too.


	A company, for example, called Haribo of America, a subsidiary of the German candy company, is building one of its largest facilities in the confectionary industry – and its very first U.S. manufacturing plant – in Pleasant Prairie, Wisconsin.


	It’s a $242 million dollar project to create roughly 400 new jobs here in the United States, and Scott Walker said this new facility will be one of the largest investments in new operations by an overseas company in Wisconsin’s history. And he promised me there would be more to follow.


	On the East Coast, in Raleigh, North Carolina, will be the home of North Carolina Technology and Innovation Hub built by India’s IT and consulting company Infosys.


	As part of its plan to create 10,000 American jobs over the next two years, Infosys plans to hire 2,000 Americans for its Raleigh hub by 2021.


	The company has also partnered with North Carolina Community College System to create a customized program to recruit and train and ultimately hire the workforce of the future, and we’re pleased to have representatives from Infosys here with us today.


	The Trump administration is committed to an environment for business that will keep generating this kind of prosperity. It means a lot, because in my role as Secretary of State, I recognize that only an economically strong America can fulfill its commitments to our allies and deter our aggressors from imperiling the global good.


	When countries cooperate for economic success, it strengthens our alliances. Prosperous partners have a greater ability to confront real security challenges that we all face and threaten each of our countries. And these threats are real. Whether that is terrorism, illegal migration, or rogue state actors, we need robust economic growth among our partners and allies to push back.


	And the State Department is a key player in facilitating commerce that benefits both the American people and our partners.


	We have 200 economic and business officers in Washington, D.C. and over 1,500 economic officers that serve in over 190 countries around the world.


	Many of them are specifically dedicated to helping international businesses and investors navigate the global commercial space and understand our market here in the United States.


	Reach out to them. They’ll help answer your questions, they’ll resolve concerns, they can connect you with investment specialists throughout the United States Government. It is an important part of the State Department that I am now privileged to lead.


	And I’m also delighted – I know we have a number of our chiefs of mission, our senior ambassadors and charges here with us. I encourage you all to reach out to them in your country. They know that a priority for the United States is helping commerce both here in America and in the countries in which they serve.


	We work hand in hand in these places with our foreign commercial service partners. They’re in 75 countries themselves. This large presence and close coordination reflects the U.S. Government’s unified view and dedication to growing prosperity all around the world.


	These advocacy efforts are extended to foreign companies as you require them, and they’re based on tenders that are made here in the United States.


	And to the American business community, I want to add this: Our diplomats are ready to help you too. If you travel on international business, please use our embassies. Come on by and say hello. We’re – our doors are open. We can provide insights on market conditions and help you navigate regulatory environments in every nation in the world.


	I want to emphasize one more thing that I think is very important for you to know: U.S. economic leadership is built on principles of fairness and a level playing field, and the State Department has as its mission to achieve this goal.


	We will fight to protect the interests of U.S. intellectual property right holders all around the world, and you can have confidence that we will work to protect your innovation from theft, from copyright violations, or from other misuse.


	As I close today, I’m confident telling you the United States is indeed the best destination in the entire world for entrepreneurship and innovation.


	And to our international investors, we welcome you. We hope that you’ll find good investment opportunities. I saw the bars were full last night in downtown. I was passing by. (Laughter.)


	Let us know how we can help you. Enjoy your time here in the United States. Bring your investment dollars. We welcome you.


	I want to echo the sentiments of my cabinet colleagues Secretary Acosta, Secretary Mnuchin, Secretary Perry, and Secretary Ross. They all feel the same way.


	We want to make sure that America is the place for your investments to succeed. Thank you and God bless you, and hope you have a great stay here in the United States. (Applause.)

	On World Refugee Day, we join the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and our international partners in commemorating the strength, courage, and resilience of millions of refugees worldwide who have been forced to flee their homes due to persecution and conflict.


	As global displacement has reached record levels, it is vital that new actors – including governments, international financial institutions, and the private sector – come to the table to assist in the global response to address it. The United States will continue to be a world leader in providing humanitarian assistance and working to forge political solutions to the underlying conflicts that drive displacement.


	The United States provides more humanitarian assistance than any other single country worldwide, including to refugees. In FY 2017 alone, the United States provided more than $8 billion in life-saving humanitarian assistance, which included food, shelter, healthcare, education, and vocational training and livelihoods to tens of millions of crisis-affected people worldwide, including refugees. This assistance is provided as close to refugees’ homes as possible in order to facilitate their voluntary, safe, and dignified return if and when conditions allow. This commitment to the world’s most vulnerable individuals remains a critical component of America’s national security policy.


	The United States was one of the first international donors to the Rakhine State crisis, providing nearly $204 million in life-saving assistance to those displaced in Burma, Rohingya and other refugees in Bangladesh, and host communities since August 2017.


	In the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the U.S. government remains the largest single country donor, having provided nearly $277 million in response to increased insecurity and violence against civilians since October 2016. This funding helps the 4.5 million displaced people within the country as well as more than 700,000 Congolese refugees in the region.


	The United States also maintains a steadfast commitment to getting life-saving support to Syrians wherever they are. Since the start of the crisis, the United States has provided nearly $8.1 billion in humanitarian assistance for the millions of people displaced inside Syria and the region.


	Since 1975, the United States has accepted more than 3.3 million refugees for permanent resettlement – more than any other country in the world. The United States will continue to prioritize the admission of the most vulnerable refugees while upholding the safety and security of the American people.


	Through active humanitarian diplomacy, humanitarian assistance, and tireless efforts to end conflicts and achieve durable solutions for persecuted people around the world, we will continue to help the world’s most vulnerable refugees, reflecting the deeply held values of the American people.

SECRETARY POMPEO: Good afternoon. The Trump administration is committed to protecting and promoting the God-given dignity and freedom of every human being. Every individual has rights that are inherent and inviolable. They are given by God, and not by government. Because of that, no government must take them away.


	For decades, the United States has led global efforts to promote human rights, often through multilateral institutions. While we have seen improvements in certain human rights situations, for far too long we have waited while that progress comes too slowly or in some cases never comes. Too many commitments have gone unfulfilled.


	President Trump wants to move the ball forward. From day one, he has called out institutions or countries who say one thing and do another. And that’s precisely the problem at the Human Rights Council. As President Trump said at the UN General Assembly: “It is a massive source of embarrassment to the United Nations that some governments with egregious human rights records sit on the Human Rights Council.”


	We have no doubt that there was once a noble vision for this council. But today, we need to be honest – the Human Rights Council is a poor defender of human rights.


	Worse than that, the Human Rights Council has become an exercise in shameless hypocrisy – with many of the world’s worst human rights abuses going ignored, and some of the world’s most serious offenders sitting on the council itself.


	The only thing worse than a council that does almost nothing to protect human rights is a council that covers for human rights abuses and is therefore an obstacle to progress and an impediment to change. The Human Rights Council enables abuses by absolving wrongdoers through silence and falsely condemning those who have committed no offense. A mere look around the world today demonstrates that the council has failed in its stated objectives.


	Its membership includes authoritarian governments with unambiguous and abhorrent human rights records, such as China, Cuba, and Venezuela.


	There is no fair or competitive election process, and countries have colluded with one another to undermine the current method of selecting members.


	And the council’s continued and well-documented bias against Israel is unconscionable. Since its creation, the council has adopted more resolutions condemning Israel than against the rest of the world combined.


	The United States has no opposition in principle to multilateral bodies working to protect human rights. We desire to work with our allies and partners on this critical objective that reflects America’s commitment to freedom.


	But when organizations undermine our national interests and our allies, we will not be complicit. When they seek to infringe on our national sovereignty, we will not be silent.


	The United States – which leads the world in humanitarian assistance, and whose service members have sacrificed life and limb to free millions from oppression and tyranny – will not take lectures form hypocritical bodies and institution as Americans selflessly give their blood and treasure to help the defenseless.


	Ambassador Haley has spent more than a year trying to reform the Human Rights Council.


	She is the right leader to drive our efforts in this regard at the United Nations. Her efforts in this regard have been tireless.


	She has asserted American leadership on everything from the Assad regime’s chemical weapons use, to the pressure campaign against North Korea, and the Iran-backed provocations in the Middle East.


	Ambassador Haley has been fearless and a consistent voice on behalf of our ally Israel. And she has a sincere passion to protect the security, dignity, and the freedom of human beings around the world – all while putting American interests first. She has been a fierce defender of human rights around the world.


	I will now turn it over to Ambassador Haley for her announcement on how the United States will move forward with respect to the UN Human Rights Council.


AMBASSADOR HALEY: Thank you. Good afternoon. I want to thank Secretary Pompeo for his friendship and his partnership and his leadership as we move forward on these issues.


	One year ago, I traveled to the United Nations Human Rights Council in Geneva. On that occasion, I outlined the U.S. priorities for advancing human rights and I declared our intent to remain a part of the Human Rights Council if essential reforms were achieved. These reforms were needed in order to make the council a serious advocate for human rights. For too long, the Human Rights Council has been a protector of human rights abusers and a cesspool of political bias.


	Regrettably, it is now clear that our call for reform was not heeded. Human rights abusers continue to serve on and be elected to the council. The world’s most inhumane regimes continue to escape scrutiny, and the council continues politicizing and scapegoating of countries with positive human rights records in an attempt to distract from the abusers in their ranks.


	Therefore, as we said we would do a year ago if we did not see any progress, the United States is officially withdrawing from the UN Human Rights Council. In doing so, I want to make it crystal clear that this step is not a retreat from human rights commitments; on the contrary, we take this step because our commitment does not allow us to remain a part of a hypocritical and self-serving organization that makes a mockery of human rights.


	We did not make this decision lightly. When this administration began 17 months ago, we were well aware of the enormous flaws in the Human Rights Council. We could have withdrawn immediately. We did not do that.


	Instead, we made a good-faith effort to resolve the problems. We met with ambassadors of over a dozen countries in Geneva. Last September, in President Trump’s speech before the UN General Assembly, he called for member-states to support Human Rights Council reform. During High-Level Week last year, we led a session on Human Rights Council reform cohosted by the British and Dutch foreign ministers and more than 40 other countries.


	Our efforts continued all through this year in New York, where my team met with more than 125 member-states and circulated draft texts. Almost every country we met with agrees with us in principle and behind closed doors that the Human Rights Council needs major, dramatic, systemic changes, yet no other country has had the courage to join our fight.


	Meanwhile, the situation on the council has gotten worse, not better. One of our central goals was to prevent the world’s worst human rights abusers from gaining Human Rights Council membership. What happened? In the past year, the Democratic Republic of Congo was elected as a member. The DRC is widely known to have one of the worst human rights records in the world. Even as it was being elected to membership in the Human Rights Council, mass graves continued to be discovered in the Congo.


	Another of our goals was to stop the council from protecting the world’s worst human rights abusers. What happened? The council would not even have a meeting on the human rights conditions in Venezuela. Why? Because Venezuela is a member of the Human Rights Council, as is Cuba, as is China.


	Similarly, the council failed to respond in December and January when the Iranian regime killed and arrested hundreds of citizens simply for expressing their views.


	When a so-called Human Rights Council cannot bring itself to address the massive abuses in Venezuela and Iran, and it welcomes the Democratic Republic of Congo as a new member, the council ceases to be worthy of its name. Such a council, in fact, damages the cause of human rights.


	And then, of course, there is the matter of the chronic bias against Israel. Last year, the United States made it clear that we would not accept the continued existence of agenda item seven, which singles out Israel in a way that no other country is singled out. Earlier this year, as it has in previous years, the Human Rights Council passed five resolutions against Israel – more than the number passed against North Korea, Iran, and Syria combined. This disproportionate focus and unending hostility towards Israel is clear proof that the council is motivated by political bias, not by human rights.


	For all these reasons, the United States spent the past year engaged in a sincere effort to reform the Human Rights Council. It is worth examining why our efforts didn’t succeed. At its core, there are two reasons. First, there are many unfree countries that simply do not want the council to be effective. A credible human rights council poses a real threat to them, so they opposed the steps that would create it.


	Look at the council membership and you see an appalling disrespect for the most basic human rights. These countries strongly resist any effort to expose their abusive practices. In fact, that’s why many of them run for a seat on the Human Rights Council in the first place: to protect themselves from scrutiny. When we made it clear we would strongly pursue council reform, these countries came out of the woodwork to oppose it. Russia, China, Cuba, and Egypt all attempted to undermine our reform efforts this past year.


	The second reason our reforms didn’t succeed is in some ways even more frustrating. There are several countries on the Human Rights Council who do share our values. Many of them strongly urged us to remain engaged in the council. They are embarrassed by the obsessive mistreatment of Israel. They share our alarm with the hypocrisy of countries like Cuba, Venezuela, Democratic Republic of Congo, and others serving on the council.


	Ultimately, however, many of these likeminded countries were unwilling to seriously challenge the status quo. We gave them opportunity after opportunity and many months of consultations, and yet they would not take a stand unless it was behind closed doors. Some even admittedly were fine with the blatant flaws of the council as long as they could pursue their own narrow agenda within the current structure.


	We didn’t agree with such a moral compromise when the previous UN Human Rights Commission was disbanded in 2006, and we don’t agree with it now. Many of these countries argued that the United States should stay on the Human Rights Council because American participation is the last shred of credibility that the council has. But that is precisely why we must leave. If the Human Rights Council is going to attack countries that uphold human rights and shield countries that abuse human rights, then America should not provide it with any credibility. Instead, we will continue to lead on human rights outside the misnamed Human Rights Council.


	Last year, during the United States presidency of the Security Council, we initiated the first ever Security Council session dedicated to the connection between human rights and peace and security. Despite protests and prohibitions, we did organize an event on Venezuela outside the Human Rights Council chambers in Geneva. And this past January, we did have a Security Council session on Iranian human rights in New York.


	I have traveled to the – to UN refugee and internally displaced persons camps in Ethiopia, Congo, Turkey, and Jordan, and met with the victims of atrocities in those troubled regions. We have used America’s voice and vote to defend human rights at the UN every day, and we will continue to do so. Even as we end our membership in the Human Rights Council, we will keep trying to strengthen the entire framework of the UN engagement on human rights issues, and we will continue to strongly advocate for reform of the Human Rights Council. Should it become reformed, we would be happy to rejoin it.


	America has a proud legacy as a champion of human rights, a proud legacy as the world’s largest provider of humanitarian aid, and a proud legacy of liberating oppressed people and defeating tyranny throughout the world. While we do not seek to impose the American system on anyone else, we do support the rights of all people to have freedoms bestowed on them by their creator. That is why we are withdrawing from the UN Human Rights Council, an organization that is not worthy of its name.


	Thank you.

SECRETARY POMPEO: Thank you. Thanks, Gerry, and thanks to the Detroit Economic Club for hosting me. It’s great to be with you. The whole Twitter thing up there makes me really nervous. (Laughter.) And to be – to have my name mentioned in the same sentence with folks like Rusk and Kissinger and Shultz, I find it odd and humbling and truly driving me every day to try to do my job in a way that honors our country in the same way that each of them did.


	Before I came here – when the speech was originally set I was the CIA Director. That’s when I originally accepted the invitation. So my remarks were about espionage and economics. I’ll come back to that. But my role is a bit different today, a little more public. You’ll note I got the Michigan deal – I didn’t go blue or green, I wore red, the neutral here, as I understand it. The same issue with my family between Army and Navy, always wear the black and gold.


	President Trump quintessentially understands that for us to achieve our foreign policy goals we need strength here at home, that thriving communities like here in Detroit are true force multipliers for us all across the globe. He knows that strength abroad is impossible without strength at home. And so I’m excited to talk to you about today what the State Department does, how we do our part to assist you all in wealth creation, how we help American businesses and families, and perhaps most importantly, why that matters, why that matters in the role that I have today.


	Now, I know when you just heard me talk about how we’re going to help you – when someone from the government tells you they’re here to help, it raises an eyebrow or two. I get that. I was in the private sector, as Gerry mentioned, for most of my life – most of my adult life. I ran two small businesses. They were manufacturing companies. But before that I was the employee of the month at Baskin-Robbins twice. (Laughter.) My mother was really proud. No one else, but my mom thought that was pretty nifty.


	The businesses we built depended on a strong America and global customer base. The first business we sold parts to, Boeing and Gulfstream and Lockheed and Cessna and Raytheon – all the airframe manufacturers – we grew it to over 100 million-dollar-a-year company virtually from scratch, and each of those companies were selling their product in turn all around the world.


	Those people that worked with me there at Thayer Aerospace were real Americans. They often had a second job on a farm milking, working the land, besides the time they spent running a lathe or a mill. And I’d say the same thing about the oil field company that I ran. We sold mechanical parts, steel goods, to the down-the-hole drillers: pumps, swivel hooks, and the like.


	I tell that story to you today, that part of my life to you because it is central to my understanding of how it is the State Department needs to enable a strong America and successful foreign policy. It’s not because I’m looking for a job. I’ve got all the work I can handle today, I assure you. But I want you to know that I consider the economic elements of what the State Department does a little less noticed but equally important with the other work.


	Most of the time you hear about the State Department, it’ll be something we’ve done around the world – in North Korea or Iran or in Africa – but in fact, economic diplomacy has always been central, when done right, to the State Department’s mission.


	What that means is we use American power, economic might, and influence as a tool of policy to help America achieve its interests and promote our values around the world. And if we do that right, it in turn cycles back to prosperity at home. We build relationships that create jobs and sustain American businesses and spur economic growth here at home. We do our best to call out unfair economic behavior as well and break down barriers to market entry so that our companies have fair and reciprocal opportunities to sell into markets all around the world.


	It goes back a long ways. You mentioned three of the great names. Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson wrote in 1790 that it was central for him to protect American trade in the Mediterranean – and noted that it was suffering because North African pirates were attacking our commercial ships. A little different problem today, but the theft of our stuff remains a central challenge for America.


	Today we have over 200 officers serving in our Economic Bureau and 1,500 economic officers serving in embassies all across the world. Each of those individuals has the job to make sure that we continue to have the most robust economy, the most dynamic economy, in the entire world. We hope we can help you in that way, too. As you travel the world, we welcome you coming to visit. We’ll share the insights that we have about operating there. We’ll help you with regulatory challenges in those places as well. It is indeed our task to help American companies have the opportunity to succeed around the world.


	And we have partners at the Foreign Commercial Service from the Department of Commerce who also do this same work. I do hope that you will take advantage of this resource that you, American taxpayers, have provided.


	We have a good example that’s here in the room with us today. Our embassy in Nicaragua, in tandem with the Department of Commerce, works with local partners, Flex Building Systems – I met a few of you in the back somewhere back there – a Michigan company that makes prefab housing products. We’re proud to work with Flex. They have provided fast and affordable housing solutions in the wake of a number of natural disasters and have helped build schools, clinics, and hospitals in remote parts of Central America and the Caribbean and Africa. I’m glad you all are here today. It’s a good example of the State Department working alongside entrepreneurs to successfully solve problems and create wealth here in America.


	If we get this right, economic diplomacy also does strengthen our national security. President Trump’s strategy says that economic security is indeed national security. They are, as he has described it, synonymous. Making sure each of you has the opportunity to do what you do best is critical for – the stemming the – creating the prosperity that undergirds our security and freedoms.


	Economic diplomacy too strengthens alliances around the world, as well. I saw this when I ran my two small businesses. The world knows that American economy is the largest and most influential and, frankly, the most innovative on the planet. It’s the envy of our allies and our adversaries. That economic might is one of the most important tools, it’s one of the biggest pieces of street cred, that I have as I travel the world. Without it I’d have much less leverage. It allows us to galvanize our allies towards shared goals and uphold our commitments to them.


	And our team in the Trump administration is committed to economic diplomacy. I’ve talked to the President about it many times. The first mission – he reminds me always – is to create jobs and generate wealth here in the United States. But to do that we have to engage internationally. But before I talk about that, I do want to talk about the domestic record we’ve built now in some 17 months: nearly 3 million jobs, over 300,000 in manufacturing – something that was important to me and important to this great city, and over 300,000 new construction jobs as well; unemployment the lowest since April of 2000; and for every new regulation, we’ve gotten rid of 22. This helps cherry farmers and automakers here in Michigan, energy producers in places like Kansas, and frankly, every employer in between. And the tax cuts have left $3.2 trillion in the hands of you and not the government. Sixty-seven percent of Americans now believe that it’s a good time to find jobs. There are now more jobs available than job seekers seeking them. We need to continue to grow the jobs and continuing to create a workforce that can support them.


	This economic upswing I have heard you all talk about here in Detroit itself. You refer to it as the renaissance, the renewal here in Detroit. You should be very proud of it. We think it’s taking place all across America, and we see data that supports that belief. We think this is important to businesses but most important to the men and women who you spoke about, who are today in flip-flops, who will soon be out looking for their summer job or their first job out of high school in a trade or with their college diploma seeking work somewhere here in America. We have an obligation in the State Department to create opportunities for them.


	I went through the laundry list of the President’s accomplishments because what I do every day complements them. None of those were centrally State Department initiatives. But I know that. I know that if you all don’t have the opportunity to sell goods abroad and to purchase components from abroad as well, then that growth will diminish, and we just simply can’t let that happen. With $21 trillion in debt, there is an enormous amount of economic growth that we need to sustain our way of life.


	But I have to tell you too I’ve seen this. I saw it – I see this in my current role, and I saw it in my previous role as the director the CIA as well. This dynamic nature of our economy teaches. It teaches others around the world. Our model is not the model that’s been adopted in many parts. Frankly, some of the most successful economies today haven’t adopted our model, but I am confident that they will. They will do so because capitalism and the dynamic nature of America is essential to economic success. And you can avoid that for a little while, but at the end of the day, the dynamism, the creativity, and the innovation that follow from that can only happen in a political environment that is like ours, with fairness and opportunity for every individual to become a success.


	I want to talk about a handful of ways that the State Department is involved in this. First, we’re working to maintain American sovereignty on the world economic scene. If the U.S. Government does not participate in robust international economic engagement, we will lose out to places like China. But we can never lose our economic sovereignty in doing so. The experience of Brexit, which is ongoing, and of the European Union shows us that it is difficult to recover economic independence once it’s relinquished. It also shows that the economic policies that centralize power diminish the free market’s capacity for wealth creation and the success of both consumers and businesses alike.


	Second, the State Department has a primary responsibility ensuring markets are open. Since we’ve taken office, we’ve had many successes in breaking down barriers, but there remains a great deal of work to do.


	For example, South Korea has agreed to allow many more U.S. auto exports – long a priority for the Big Three here in Detroit – and it’s addressing other concerns about the U.S.-Korea trade arrangement as well. In Argentina we’ve gotten them to reopen their pork market to U.S. producers that was closed since 1992. Overall, we are convinced if it’s an American product, we want to gain access for it; and when we do have access, I am confident that Americans will outcompete our competitors nearly every time.


	Third, we’re working hard to attract international investment here in the United States. Many of us, including my small business, depended on it. As part of our push with Saudi Arabia, we’re looking for them to put more money into America. During the President’s first trip, he got billions of dollars’ worth of new money coming from outside here into the United States. When that money comes, we get private sector investment from the United States along with it as well.


	Fourth, we’ll capitalize on Americans’ abundant energy resources. It is an enormous comparative advantage. It’s common sense to take advantage of this and to bring the copious reserves that we now have not only identified but determined how to produce at an economic price that can compete just about anywhere in the world. We’ve done this in places like North Dakota and Ohio and Pennsylvania, and so many others. Indeed, increasing our exports is central to our security. If we can export to Europe, we put Russia on its back foot. If we can export to Asia, we can do the same with China.


	We’ve watched energy diplomacy benefit companies like Cheniere that is exporting cubic – or excuse me, natural gas to over two dozen countries from its port in Louisiana, nearly 1,000 direct jobs and over 100,000 indirect jobs already created.


	We’ve also provided technical assistance on the other end to countries who would much prefer to take American energy product than that from others for whom they may become dependent and would use that in a way that wasn’t in their country’s best interest.


	Finally, we’re taking a really hard line on foreign practices that harm America. Whether that’s threatening our technology leadership through intellectual property theft or forced technology transfer, we are hard at ensuring that we protect American property. Everyone knows today that China is the main perpetrator. It’s at an unprecedented level of larceny. I was with President Xi on Thursday night. I reminded him that that’s not fair competition.


	Chinese actors also continue to conduct cyber activity, so they’re not just taking it by forced technology transfer or stealing it by way of contract, but committing outright theft. We have an enormous responsibility, each of us, to work to stop it.


	Chinese investment, too, around the world – it’s welcome, but we need to make sure that it doesn’t come with terms that advantage China in our market or our commercial. To the extent they engage in behavior that American businesses would never engage in, that is using investment to exert political influence and control over rival nations, American diplomacy has an obligation to do our best to respond to it.


	You’ve seen that with some of President Trump’s decisions with respect to tariffs. For too long, America has allowed the free trade framework to become distorted to the advantages of countries other than the United States. Remember that our diplomacy puts American workers and American businesses first.


	This isn’t just China. President Trump has clearly said that the asymmetric trade relationships with the G7 also need to be fundamentally reconsidered. They need to lower their trade barriers; they need to accept our vegetables, our beef, our fruits, our machine products. These are non-tariff barriers that ought not to exist if free and fair trade is to be achieved.


	It’s a simple moral principle, this idea of fairness. As you saw at the G7, President Trump made very clear we are happy to have 0 percent tariffs on every product. We are happy to eliminate all subsidies. We’d be thrilled to see non-tariff barriers eliminated in their entirety. If every country does that, we will too, and I am confident that will grow America.


	You’ve seen this same idea when it comes to our securing our nation as well. The President talks a lot about national security burden-sharing. We’ve seen it in North Korea too, and we’ve seen our allies respond. The effort that President Trump took last week in Singapore could not have happened without real economic diplomacy. President Trump rallied every nation in the world to pressure North Korea in a way that it would begin to rethink its own security and to come to view its nuclear weapon system not as a security blanket but, in fact, as the one thing that could threaten their leadership and their regime. It was economic diplomacy succeeding.


	There’s still much work to do. I’ll be hard at it in the days and weeks ahead. But we have now set the conditions where the North Korean people can also have economic success. As the President says, a brighter future for North Korea does not come at the expense of anyone, but benefits us all.


	There’s a long history of this, of us being successful. We forget about things like the Marshall Plan. We gave $110 billion – these were dollars of a long time ago – to Europe. We did it to provide assistance to our European partners when they needed help. But we’re now 70 years on from those days, and it is the case that we need to make sure that we re-evaluate each of those relationships so that we can continue to have great trade with Canada and great trade with Europe in the years ahead.


	If you look around, there have been those that have criticized some of the tariffs. But just ask yourself: Would China have allowed America to do to it what China has done to America?


	Take their aluminum and steel industries. China produces steel and aluminum in a way that exceeds domestic demands by far. They don’t want to shut down that production, and so the exported product. The excess product comes here to America, prices where American companies can’t compete.


	This is predatory economics 101, and many other countries have recognized this. President Trump is now working to re-shift this balance.


	Chinese leaders over these past few weeks have been claiming openness and globalization, but it’s a joke. Let’s be clear: It’s the most predatory economic government that operates against the rest of the world today. This is a problem that is long overdue in being tackled.


	On NAFTA and Mexico, the President’s working hard. I am confident that we will get deals, deals that will be good for Mexico, a deal that will be good for Canada, and deals that will be wonderful for American workers. A lot changed in the 24 years since NAFTA was first put in place, and our goal is to achieve an outcome that rebalances that situation. We’re going to level the playing field for the American automotive industry and other sectors, incentivizing manufacturing here and not there.


	This obviously matters a lot to you all here in Michigan; it accounts for 23 percent of all automotive production. Our NAFTA negotiating teams are working closely with our Canadian and Mexican counterparts, and I am very hopeful that in the coming weeks, we will be able to announce that we have agreements that I think the world will view as significantly better for the global economy. I’m an optimist by nature. My work requires it too. I know you are as well.


	This region that was home to the Arsenal of Democracy in World War II has been on hard times for a bit, and there’s still a way to go. But we’re seeing this new growth; we’re seeing it in every big city in America. We believe in you in the Trump administration. We are confident that if we can help you gain access to markets and get trade rebalanced that you, the people here in Detroit, will be successful.


	I’ll close with this: for every small company in America, there’s an opportunity. There’s an opportunity to access a place that you’ve never been or never seen or never known. I am convinced that if we at the State Department do our jobs well, that you too will be able to do that. And you’ll do it in a way that benefits you and your business and your family, and that’s great.


	But the most important thing you will do is you will do that for those around you and for your community. And it’s that that drives us every day at the State Department to lead the economic team in a way that delivers American diplomacy every place in the world, and the American economy can continue to be the beacon around the world that it has been for all these years.


	Thank you. Thanks for allowing me to be at the Detroit Economic Club. It’s truly an honor for me to be with you all today, and I’m happy to take just a – I used to say I’ll – I’d take a question about anything, now I say almost anything. So thank you. (Applause.) Thank you.


MR ANDERSON: All right. Well, Mr. Secretary, we do have some questions that have come in, both before the address and during it, and not surprisingly, given the presence of the auto industry in Detroit, as you mentioned, and the fact that so much of the country’s trade with Canada flows across our joint border here, there were numerous questions submitted on trade negotiations, tariffs and their impacts on relationships. So I’d try to sum up those questions by saying – asking what is your perspective on the impact of trade negotiations and tariff impositions on relationships with Canada. That was probably question number one, but similar questions for our close allies in Europe and with China.


SECRETARY POMPEO: I am convinced – I spoke with my Canadian counterpart on Saturday morning, Chrystia Freeland. I think she agrees. I am convinced when – when the trade negotiations are complete, that there will be more – more volume, more dollars and greater freedom of trade between the United States and Canada. I am completely convinced of it. I’ve seen the work that’s been going on. There were just some things that are out of whack, and that may be historic artifice or maybe that times simply move on – some things that didn’t match with today’s environment. And the President is determined to try and correct them. And I’d say the same thing about Europe and Mexico too. I’d put them all in the same bucket in that way.


	But I think it’s also the case that our relationships with them are so much greater than just our economic relationships with those countries. When I spoke to Chrystia, we certainly spoke about tariffs and the things that were very much on all of our minds, but we work alongside each other in Ukraine. They have folks that are working with us in Afghanistan. She offered to assist in our efforts in North Korea. The Canadians have been incredibly important in that. I’d say the same thing for the European and Mexicans. Our relationship is not solely defined by trade, and so I am – I’m very confident that when these trade negotiations are completed that the historic relationships between the United States and Canada and the United States and our European partners will continue the way they have for now 70-odd years with Europe.


MR ANDERSON: Great. Not surprisingly, there were also a number of questions related to the recent summit with North Korea. So combining a couple of them, will a follow-up summit be necessary to build on and solidify the results of the recent meetings with North Korea? And what is the perspective of the Russians and the Chinese on the evolving U.S. relationship with North Korea?


SECRETARY POMPEO: So let me take the second one first. When I traveled to Beijing after Singapore, spoke with my Russian counterpart this morning at 8:15 Eastern, they are excited that there’s this opportunity. It’s their backyard, after all. To eliminate the proliferation threat, the nuclear threat in North Korea, is something that they have long stated they were desirous for, but there wasn’t a motive force to drive it. So I am sure our interests diverge in certain places there, but the core opportunity to fundamentally reshape how North Korea thinks about itself and its place in the community of nations – both Russia and China are fully on board with our effort.


	As for whether they’ll need another summit, hard to know. There is a lot of work between here and there. My team is already doing it. I’ll likely travel back before too terribly long. There’s a great deal of work to do. We still have to flesh out all the things that underlay the commitments that were made that day in Singapore. I was there in the room with Chairman Kim. It was the third time I’d met Chairman Kim; twice in Pyongyang and there in Singapore now. He has made very clear his commitment to fully denuclearize his country. That’s everything, right? It’s not just the weapon systems, it’s everything. (Applause.)


	In return for that, the President has committed to making sure that we alter the armistice agreement, provide the security assurances that Chairman Kim needs. And I don’t know if you’ve had the chance to see the video that President Trump showed Chairman Kim that day in the meeting, but it talks about – it shows what North Korea could be like: beautiful beaches, a wonderful place, successful. There is a lot of work to do to make that, but President Trump is committed to delivering on that part of the bargain as well. And if we can get those two done in a way that matches, we will have reduced a global threat that has bedeviled the United States and the world for decades.


MR ANDERSON: Great, thank you. Switching continents now, Africa appears to be evolving and transforming rapidly; and further, China is asserting itself on the continent. So the continent also has serious issues with extremist groups. Given all of this, what role can and should the U.S. play on the continent?


SECRETARY POMPEO: So, actually, my last trip as CIA director was to Africa. I traveled to six countries in about as many days, confronting each of those problems, frankly: the risk from al-Shabaab and al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb; working on economic matters as well in other parts of the country; and then in Djibouti to watch the Chinese building a port right next to a perfectly good, useful port, certainly to be designed ultimately to be a Chinese military facility.


	So when I stare at Africa, I see two challenges. The first is, to the extent there’s Islamic extremism that threatens America, we have an obligation to go take it down and protect the homeland. But the second one is opportunity. I see enormous economic growth. The people growth there will be larger than anyplace else on a per capita basis, on a percentage basis, than anyplace else in world over the next decade or two. Economic growth is lagging behind, but there are places where we believe we can be successful at helping them climb quickly.


	As we all know, continents surprise. When they have small economies, they can grow at 8, 10, and 14 percent a year. It’s not unprecedented. If we can put in place the building blocks, the ones we all know, right, the rule of law, property rights, sort of some of the central understandings of how economic growth take place, I am confident that that growth will occur with a model that looks more like the West than China. If you look at what China’s doing there, there’s a lot of money going in, but boy, those leaders are getting smart to it. That money’s coming at a price that they know isn’t about commerce and markets, but rather about ultimately calling the note when it’s time to exert political influence. And the African leaders are on to it, they’re deeply aware of it, and they’re looking for alternatives. An American presence, not just the government’s presence but your presence, has a real opportunity to both return capital to you, to get ROI on your investment, and to achieve an Africa that has interests that are much more closely aligned to those of us here in the West than in China.


MR ANDERSON: Great. Well, another situation that’s been in the news and was asked about has to do with Venezuela, and the question was: Venezuela continues to struggle with enormous issues, both economic and political. Is there a workable path forward there?


SECRETARY POMPEO: So it’s a big challenge. Venezuela has been the next great economic success story for the last 40 years. So I shall not predict that one more time, too much risk. The Maduro regime has proven tenacious and capable at maintaining power, and inflicting enormous pain on the Venezuelan people. We have done our best to allow South and Central America to take the lead at responding to this crisis and urged Venezuela to return to something that looks much more democratic than where they are today. We’ve used some of our sanction authority – economic sanction authority – to facilitate that, and I’ve – my – that’s probably the best role for the United States to play. They’re calling on democratic institutions to be regenerated and allowing South and Central America to take the lead in responding to it.


MR ANDERSON: This one is, I would say, more personal and about your role. So you’ve been in your current role for a relatively short period. Have there been any surprises? And how would you compare the challenges of leading the State Department with those of leading the CIA?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Yeah, they’re totally different. (Laughter.) First of all, when I was the CIA director, I never saw a camera and I was happy about it – (laughter) – so, a very different role.


	Look, they have fundamentally different functions. The leadership challenge, though, is not terribly different. It’s not terribly different than the leadership challenge I had when I ran Thayer Aerospace or Sentry International. So taking large organizations and getting them to understand commander’s intent, and then giving them the – the people of those organizations the power and authority to go knock it out of the park. I’ve been incredibly blessed in both places, at the CIA and now at the State Department. I have incredibly capable people. America is sending some of its finest young people to come work at each of those institutions. Thank you for that.


	My job as their leader is to make sure they clearly understand what it is President Trump is trying to achieve, and in turn, how I’m trying to implement those foreign policy goals for the President. And then to get the bureaucracy out of the way, which in a government institution is an art form unto itself, but to get that bureaucracy out of the way in a way that you can empower those folks to go – to really knock it out of the park on behalf of America, where they understand what it is we’re trying to accomplish and leave to them with all their talents to do it. So the leadership challenge, that’s not different than when I ran Thayer Aerospace. It was much smaller than these two, but creating that place.


	I’ve talked about, at the State Department, the other element. We are all around the world, and the world is watching how America behaves. And I remind our officers – I had a chance to talk to our team in Seoul and our team in Beijing, in addition to the team in Singapore, reminding our officers that the world is watching them. So we have policies and there are things we’re trying to accomplish, but while we’re doing each of those tasks, the world’s watching our behavior. Do we tell the truth? Do we behave with courtesy? Do we treat every human being with the dignity they deserve? These are quintessentially American value sets, and if we do that, the good we will do in the process of trying to implement America’s values and interests around the world and achieve them will have the corollary benefit of, again, showing the best of what America is about. And that frankly is no different in my current role than it was at CIA, but very different than in the private sector.


MR ANDERSON: Well, maybe we will wrap up with one international question that’s a little closer to home, and that’s a question about Cuba. So Cuba now has the first non-Castro president in many decades. Do you continue to think we’ll grow closer with Cuba? How do you see that relationship evolve?


SECRETARY POMPEO: It’s true his last name’s not Castro. (Laughter.) But you wouldn’t know it from looking at his policies and plans. So I don’t see significant changes in the Cuban Government. Having said that, I do see significant opportunity. I think over time that its proximity to the United States, the nature of the human beings there, I think we – I think ultimately we end up in a much better place in Cuba. The question has always been speed, how quickly can you get there, and what are the right toolsets to reinforce that and make that more likely to happen. President Trump’s made clear he wants us to do that, he wants us to be engaged in ways that increase the capacity for ordinary Cubans to have the opportunities that we all have in America, both economic freedoms and political freedoms. And today we still have a lot of work to do.


MR ANDERSON: With that I am going to wrap up the Q&A session, but I just want to finish where I started, in thanking you for taking the time today to come to Detroit. Your message was great, and great for us to hear. Much appreciated. Thank you so much.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Great. Thank you all very much. (Applause.)

	The United States extends its best wishes to the people of Afghanistan in celebration of Eid al-Fitr.  We welcome the ceasefire during the period of Eid.  The Afghan people this year are spending the Eid holidays with their families with renewed hope of peace.


	We support President Ghani’s offer to extend the ceasefire and begin peace talks.  As President Ghani emphasized in his statement to the Afghan people, peace talks by necessity would include a discussion of the role of international actors and forces.  The United States is prepared to support, facilitate, and participate in these discussions. 


	All of Afghanistan’s people benefit from the end of bloodshed, and we have seen the overwhelmingly positive reaction from Afghans across society.  We have seen pictures of Islamic Republic of Afghanistan soldiers and police with Taliban fighters offering prayers for Eid side by side.  If Afghans can pray together, their leaders can talk together and resolve their differences.


	Agreeing to begin peace talks is an expression of determination to create a unified Afghanistan in which all its citizens can live in peace and dignity.  The United States stands ready to work with the Afghan government, the Taliban, and all the people of Afghanistan to reach a peace agreement and political settlement that brings a permanent end to this war.

	On behalf of the United States of America, I offer congratulations to the people of Iceland on your 74th anniversary of independence on June 17th.


	The United States was the first to recognize Iceland as an independent republic in 1944. Our countries share a commitment to transatlantic security as NATO Allies, to human rights, and to economic development. In the Arctic, we work together to promote marine research and good communications to prevent conflicts over resources and territory.


	Nothing speaks more clearly of our partnership than the July 2017 Icelandic Coast Guard rescue of three Americans lost at sea off your coast. Our close ties are only strengthened by such acts, and programs like the Fulbright Arctic Scholar Initiative that further develop leadership and the people-to-people links between our countries. We look forward to working together to further global peace and prosperity with Iceland, our key NATO Ally.

	On behalf of the U.S. Department of State, I extend my best wishes to our Muslim friends and partners celebrating Eid al-Fitr.


	This holiday marks the end of Ramadan, a month of fasting, charity, compassion, and reflection. Eid al-Fitr reminds all of us in the United States and abroad, Muslims and non-Muslims alike, to maintain the spirit and lessons of Ramadan throughout the year: to promote peace, to be of service to those who are suffering and displaced, to respect diversity, and to empathize with everyone around us.


	The United States is proud of the strong relationships we have built with Muslim nations and communities around the world. We are also proud of the contributions of the 3.4 million American Muslims who deeply enrich our social fabric on a daily basis. These contributions reflect the United States’ bedrock principles of religious pluralism and public service.


	As you mark this special holiday with loved ones, I wish you peace and prosperity in the coming year. Eid Mubarak.

PRESIDENT XI: (Via interpreter.) Secretary Pompeo, it is, indeed, with great pleasure that I welcome you to China on this trip. I understand that this is your first visit to China in the capacity as the Secretary of State. Indeed, both of us were busy over the past couple of days. You were accompanying President Trump on the successful U.S.-DPRK summit, and now you are traveling here to Beijing to give us an update of this meeting. And on my part, I was busy traveling at home. I just landed in Beijing one hour ago. So indeed, a great pleasure to meet with you.


	Well, Mr. Secretary, you know that President Trump and I have maintained a sound working relationship, as well as a close personal friendship. We have had timely exchange of ideas on China-U.S. relationship and also we’ve had very good discussions on important regional and international issues. And Mr. Secretary, I believe that in the future you’re also going to play a major role in promoting further growth of China-U.S. relationship and you will have very good interactions with your Chinese counterparts here. We have very good dialogue mechanisms between China and the U.S. and we should make the most of those mechanisms. You’ll have very good discussions in the future with Director Yang Jiechi and also State Councilor Wang Yi.


	And now Mr. Secretary, I’m all ears to listen to your briefing about the Singapore summit and also your views on China-U.S. relationship.

SECRETARY POMPEO: First of all, thank you very much for coming back late in the evening to meet with me. It is truly an honor to be with you in this beautiful hall.


	President Trump asked me to send his regards. I have watched your interactions. He truly values the relationship personally between the two of you and the relationship between our two countries. I personally want to wish you a happy birthday tomorrow. (Laughter.)


PRESIDENT XI: (Via interpreter.) Thank you.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Yeah, it’s just a few hours away. (Laughter.)


	But most importantly, it was very important for me to get here to share with you what President Trump and Chairman Kim accomplished in Singapore and share with you our hopes for how this process to denuclearize the peninsula and create peace there can be achieved in the weeks and months ahead.

MODERATOR: (Via translation.) Good evening everyone, State Counselor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi (inaudible). We have simultaneous interpretation throughout the press conference. Now State Counselor Wang Yi has the floor.


STATE COUNCILOR WANG: (Via translation.) Good evening friends from the media. First I would like to extend my welcome again to Secretary of State Pompeo for his visit to China. We have just had an in-depth exchange of views on China-U.S. relations and the Korean Peninsula, among other important topics of mutual concern. Both of us believe President Xi and President Trump maintained close communication over the year through meetings, phone conversations, and correspondence, which is strategically significant for the sound, stable development of the bilateral ties.


	China-U.S. relations have now entered an important phase. It has been almost four decades. The opportunities and challenges facing our ties are both increasing. Yet our common interests far outweigh our differences; we talk and work together far more than we compete. Those very dynamics have not changed. Keeping our ties on track is in line with the fundamental interest of both peoples, as well as the general expectation of the international community. The two sides will arrange high-level bilateral exchanges well, as well as exchanges at all levels, hold the second round of the four high-level dialogues, actively expand mutually beneficial cooperation, appropriately manage disputes and misunderstanding, and continue to advance people-to-people exchanges, thus further consolidating the foundation of the bilateral ties.


	So far the Chinese and U.S. economic teams have had rounds of negotiations on bilateral economic and trade issues, having reached important understanding and agreement. The fundamental point there is to handle disputes constructively. We hope the United States can meet China half way, truly respect this agreement, and facilitate appropriate solutions to relevant issues through a win-win approach, instead of a lose-lose one. While doing so, we hope the U.S. side neither continues its unilateral, unconstructive actions, nor creates new impediments to the next-step negotiations between the two sides.


	In our meeting, I reaffirmed to Mr. Secretary of State the Chinese government’s stance on Taiwan, and expressed our serious concern over some recent U.S. practices. We urge the U.S. side to keep to the one-china principle and the stipulations in the three joint communiqués, end its official engagement and any political connections with Taiwan, and handle Taiwan-related issues discreetly and appropriately, lest it unnecessarily disrupts the larger picture of China-U.S. relations.


	Mr. Secretary of State informed me of the developments from the U.S.-DPRK summit in Singapore. That was a successful historic meeting. In particular, it brought the peninsula nuclear issue on the dialogue track to seek solutions, which brings hope for peace. We highly commend the boldness both the U.S. and the DPRK leaders demonstrated. The summit is an important, auspicious start. That said, it takes time to solve the peninsula issue. We hope and believe the United States and the DPRK are able to implement the agreement made on the summit, continue to engage with each other proactively, and meet each other half way.


	Meanwhile, all parties in the region have a stake in the peninsula situation. Solutions there require the support and engagement from all. China is willing to communicate closely with all parties, including the United States and the DPRK, to continue to play its due role in promoting denuclearization and building a peace mechanism in the peninsula. Thank you.


MODERATOR: (Via translation.) Thank you State Counselor Wang. Now Secretary of State Pompeo has the floor.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Good evening. I’m delighted to be with you, Councilor Wang. I mean, it’s the second time we’ve had the chance to meet, first in Washington and now here, and it’s great to make my first trip to China as the United States Secretary of State. I want to thank all of our Chinese hosts for their incredible hospitality.


	I also want to thank China and President Xi for his role in helping bring North Korea to the negotiating table and for the continued support as we work to achieve the complete, verifiable, and irreversible denuclearization of North Korea.


	This is my third country that I’ve had the chance to speak with today. Each has reinforced three important things that happened in Singapore: First, the commitment to a fundamentally changed relationship. Japan, the Republic of Korea, and now China have all acknowledged that we have turned a corner, that we have begun a process away from the threat of war and towards peace on the peninsula. Each of those three countries too has acknowledged the importance of the work that President Trump has undertaken and the commitment that Chairman Kim has made towards that very end, to achieve that denuclearization.


	And each of those three countries has also acknowledged that it is important that the sanctions regime that is in place today remain in place until such time as that denuclearization is in fact complete. There has been unanimity in that set of objectives and I’m heartened by that following the Singapore summit.


	The United States wants a very constructive relationship with China. That means we have to make concrete progress on our top priorities. We’ve seen the power that comes when the United States and China do work together, when we don’t treat the relationship as being zero-sum. We’re stopping the flow of illegal opioids together, and this will save countless American lives and we are deeply appreciative of China’s support.


	We discussed trade today. Our deficit with China is still too high. I stressed how important it is for President Trump to rectify that situation so that trade becomes more balanced, more reciprocal and more fair, with the opportunity to have American workers be treated fairly. We had good and constructive discussions.


	We also need to make some progress between our two countries on security. As Councilor Yang mentioned, I reaffirmed our concern with respect to China’s efforts to build a militarized outpost in the South China Sea, endangering the free flow of trade and threatening the sovereignty of other nations and undermining regional stability. I urged Councilor Yang and he confirmed China’s willingness to resolve these disputes in a peaceful way without resort to threats, coercion, or intimidation. I am confident that we can continue to work together towards that end.


	When our two countries disagree, our two countries will speak up and firmly stand for each of our people. Our values, including the respect for human rights and religious freedom and the rule of law, are important. When we cooperate, the United States and China can make great progress. There is much work ahead for our two countries. I am committed to working with you and with China to achieve those objectives. Thank you.


MODERATOR: (In Chinese.)


QUESTION: (Via translation.) I have a question for State Councilor Wang. At a press conference during the “two sessions,” you mentioned that China and the United States may compete with each other but may not necessarily be rivals. The two countries need to be partners more. Your remarks draw great attention from the international community. How do you think China and the United States can achieve such a goal? Thank you.


STATE COUNCILOR WANG: (Via translation.) China and the United States, as two big countries, will inevitably compete with each other, which is quite normal among countries in the international community. The point is how we view the competition. For China, I think, the competition should be benign, positive, and designed to push oneself to excel rather than replace one another. Both sides should promote cooperation through competition and create win-win results through cooperation. Only by doing so can we truly do things in the interests of both countries and effectively assume the two countries’ correspondent responsibilities for the world.


	Next year we will usher in the 40th anniversary of the normalization of diplomatic ties between the two countries, which will be an important moment in the bilateral relations. China is willing to work with the United States to seriously implement the important consensus reached by the two Presidents, respecting each other, focusing on cooperation, and managing differences.


	Just as Mr. Secretary of State said just now, we are not in a zero-sum relationship. If we cooperate, we can indeed accomplish many great things and make a lot of important progress. We must strive to make 2019 the year of increased mutual trust between China and the United States, the year of expanded exchanges, and the year of deepened cooperation. On the one hand, both sides must strengthen all-round cooperation, tapping and contributing more positive energy to China-U.S. relations, and making more new contributions to world peace and development. On the other hand, both sides must properly handle differences and sensitive issues on the basis of mutual respect and continuously remove the stumbling blocks obstructing the development of bilateral relations.


	At present, both sides particularly need to strengthen dialogue and communication so as to avoid new disruptions to bilateral relations. This will ensure that the impetus for China-U.S. relations becomes stronger while the obstacles become smaller. In this way, we can lay a more solid foundation and open up broader prospects for the healthy and stable development of China-U.S. relations in the next 40 years. Thank you.


MODERATOR: (In Chinese.)


MS NAUERT: Next question goes to Michael Gordon from The Wall Street Journal. Keep it to one question, if you would, please. Thank you.


QUESTION: Okay. A question for State Councilor Wang: The United States has taken the position that North Korea should take major steps to dismantle its nuclear weapons and forces in a short period of time, in two and a half years. It also says, as you’ve just heard, that there should be no sanctions relief until these steps by North Korea have been taken. Will China support this approach? Will China press North Korea to take disarmament steps in the next two years? And will it pledge to withhold any sanctions relief until these steps by North Korea are carried out?


STATE COUNCILOR WANG: (Via translation.) This question should actually be answered by Mr. Secretary of State, who has just had very deep and concrete communication with the DPRK. Regarding China’s position, I think everyone is clear about it. Definitely, we will unswervingly push forward and realize peninsula denuclearization. At the same time, we also believe that North Korea’s legitimate security concerns should be resolved. That is to say, a peace mechanism on the peninsula should be established. I think China, the United States, North Korea and all parties are completely consistent with each other about this general goal.


	This is also reflected in the joint statement personally signed by President Trump and Chairman Kim Jong-un. It becomes the most important part of this [process]. As for how to carry forward the denuclearization process, well, just as Secretary of State Pompeo said, (inaudible). Well, of course, China is willing to play a constructive role in this process. Thank you.


SECRETARY POMPEO: May I add to that? State Councilor Wang and I had a good, constructive discussion on these very topics. With respect to the pace at which the denuclearization will take place, I think we both agreed that we need to do it in as timely a fashion as is possible to achieve the outcome, and that the security assurances that we’ve talked about are provided at times that are appropriate.


	We also talked at some length about the sanctions. China has reaffirmed its commitment to honoring the UN Security Council resolutions. Those have mechanisms for relief contained in them, and we agreed that at the appropriate time that those would be considered. But we have made very clear that the sanctions and the economic relief that North Korea will receive will only happen after the full denuclearization, the complete denuclearization, of North Korea.


MODERATOR: Thank you. Next question. Phoenix Television.


QUESTION: Hello Mr. Secretary of State, I am from Phoenix Television. You said that China and the United States should develop a more productive partnership, that the relationship between the two countries is not a zero-sum one, and that the two sides should achieve success together. What are the specific measures that the United States has taken and will continue taking so as to achieve these ends? Thank you!


SECRETARY POMPEO: So there are many ways that we’ll achieve that. Among the most important of them is we continue a sound strategic dialogue between our two nations, so that where there are places where we disagree we iron out those differences and that we express our interests very clearly and work towards the peaceful resolution of those conflicts.


	Make very clear: There are many things today where China and the United States work very closely together that improve the lives for the citizens of each of our two countries. I mentioned a couple of them in my opening remarks. We’ll continue to work alongside of those – on each of those. There are many, many places where our two nations are far better off working together in concert and aligned as opposed to working at interests that diverge, and I am committed to working with Councilor Wang to achieve those in every venue where our two nations operate.


MS NAUERT: Our final question goes to Rich Edson from Fox News.


QUESTION: Thank you very much. Mr. Secretary, how confident is the United States that it knows the extent of the North Korean nuclear program, and how confident are you in North Korea’s willingness to divulge that information?


	And to both of you, Mr. Foreign Minister and Mr. Secretary, did you discuss the suspected attacks on American diplomats here and have you learned any new information regarding what could be causing that?


SECRETARY POMPEO: So let me answer each of those two questions. I’ll take your second question first. The issue with respect to the American Foreign Service officer who suffered a health incident here was raised. I asked the Chinese to continue to cooperate with us to try and figure out how that happened, how it came to be, and to work with us to conduct an investigation sufficient that we can prevent it from happening again. I raised the issue, and Councilor Wang was kind in saying that he has provided and will continue to provide full support to ensuring that Americans serving here as diplomats will continue to be safe and secure, and I thank him very much for that.


	With respect to the scope and scale of the North Korean nuclear program, I don’t want to get into the details of our intelligence precisely, but we have a reasonable understanding. It is incredibly important that we get a full understanding of that as quickly as possible. And as part of the efforts that will be undertaken in the week and weeks ahead, we will work with the North Koreans to come to have a fuller understanding of that so that we can begin to execute together the commitments that President Trump and Chairman Kim made. They made real commitments to denuclearize, each of them, and President Trump made a commitment that he would provide security assurances that were commensurate with that. Those are firm commitments that the two leaders made and an understanding that the program is a piece of what will ultimately lead to our capacity to verify the full and complete denuclearization has actually taken place.


STATE COUNCILOR WANG: (Via translation.) On the so-called “sonic attack” issue, China and the United States are in continuous communication. China will also continue to ensure the legitimate rights and interests—including health—of all diplomats, including U.S. diplomats, in accordance with law. We have already conducted an investigation on the complaint of the so-called “sonic attack.” What I can tell you is that at the moment we have not identified any reasons or clues for the issue the United States reported. We are willing to continue to communicate with the U.S. side to ensure this issue...


	Lastly, I would like to say a few words about trade. Mr. Secretary of State also mentioned just now. In fact, we now face two choices. One is cooperation and win-win outcomes. Another is confrontation and double losses. We China have chosen the first one. We hope that the United States can also make the same rational choice. Of course, we are also prepared to deal with the second choice. Thank you all.


MODERATOR: (In Chinese.)

",Press Availability With Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi,http://www.state.gov/secretary/remarks/2018/06/283225.htm
"June 14, 2018","
MODERATOR: Ladies and gentlemen, we would like to now begin the Korea, U.S., and Japan Foreign Ministers Meeting joint press conference. Today, we have been joined by the Minister Kang Kyung-wha, the Secretary Pompeo, and Foreign Minister Kono. They will speak for five minutes. And as was consulted previously, Minister Kang is going to speak in the Korean language – the English language.


FOREIGN MINISTER KANG: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen of the press from Korea, from the U.S., from Japan, I also think. It is my great pleasure and honor to welcome the U.S. Secretary of State Mr. Mike Pompeo and my Japanese counterpart the Foreign Minister Taro Kono here in Seoul.


	First of all, I would like to take this opportunity to express my deep gratitude to Secretary Pompeo for coming to Seoul right after the historic summit meeting between President Trump and Chairman Kim Jong-un of North Korea on June 12th in Singapore. This is also Secretary Pompeo’s first visit to Seoul as Secretary of State. So welcome, Mr. Secretary. Your presence here today demonstrates better than anything how closely we work together to strengthen our alliance and to achieve our shared goals.


	I would also like to convey my deep gratitude to Minister Kono for maintaining close coordination for the success of the U.S.-DPRK summit, and it’s very good to have him here back in Seoul so soon after his visit in April.


	During the meeting today, Secretary Pompeo briefed us on the outcome of the June 12th U.S.-DPRK summit. I congratulated him and President Trump for the success of the summit, which will be recorded as a historic turning point towards completely ridding the Korean Peninsula of the last remnant of the Korean War, resolving the North Korean nuclear issue, and securing permanent peace on the Korean Peninsula.


	The following are the key points of our meeting today.


	First, on the U.S.-DPRK summit, the three of us welcomed the adoption of the joint statement in Singapore where Chairman Kim reaffirmed his firm and unwavering commitment to the complete denuclearization of the peninsula, while President Trump committed to provide North Korea with the security guarantees. This is the first time that the highest authority of North Korea promised the President of the United States to work towards the complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, which we believe has bolstered the political momentum for action to resolve the North Korean nuclear issue.


	Secondly, we shared our understanding that the June 12th summit is not the end but a new beginning towards a denuclearized and peaceful Korean Peninsula. In this regard, it is our shared expectation to see substantial progress in the denuclearization process through follow-up negotiations building upon the outcome of the U.S.-DPRK summit. We also hope that this process will spell out a more concrete picture of a brighter and more prosperous future for North Korea.


	Thirdly, the three of us agreed that we would not have been here where – here where we are today without the close cooperation of our leaders, especially the frequent and close communication and the trust forged between President Moon and President Trump have been the driving force that has led to the summit in Singapore and ensured its success.


	In this regard, I look forward to continuing the no-daylight cooperation and consultation with Secretary Pompeo as well as Minister Kono towards the complete denuclearization and permanent peace on the Korean Peninsula. We will continue our close cooperation with other neighboring countries as well, as well as our friends and supporters of the international community.


	And lastly, Secretary Pompeo and I reaffirmed that the ROK-U.S. alliance, which celebrates its 65th anniversary this year, is robust as ever, that the United States forces in Korea has played and will continue to play a crucial role for deterrence and peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula.


	In conclusion, let me say how grateful I am to Secretary Pompeo and Minister Kono for the fruitful exchanges of views today. Thank you very much.


MODERATOR: Now I would like to invite Secretary Pompeo to make a statement.

SECRETARY POMPEO: It’s truly an honor to be here in Seoul standing with Foreign Minister Kang and Foreign Minister Kono. It is an incredibly pivotal moment in history following on the historic summit between President Trump and Chairman Kim Jong-un. The trilateral cooperation among the United States, South Korea, and Japan has been crucial to the effectiveness regarding our efforts regarding – regarding our efforts related to the denuclearization of North Korea, and it was certainly key to our opportunity for the summit in Singapore.


	The discussions we held today amongst the three of us reflect our three countries’ commitment to continue working together towards the ultimate success of this effort. Today, the foreign minister and I discussed the outcome of President Trump’s summit with Chairman Kim Jong-un and the importance of staying closely coordinated throughout the entire process of denuclearization.


	The President’s summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un two days ago does indeed mark a turning point in the U.S.-North Korea relationship. Kim Jong-un’s public commitment to completely denuclearize is an important step towards bringing lasting peace and stability to Northeast Asia and indeed to the entire world.


	As the President said, this will be a process and not an easy one. Staying closely aligned with our allies, the Republic of Korea and Japan, will be critical to the success of that outcome. The world should rest assured that the United States, the Republic of Korea, and Japan remain committed to achieving the complete, verifiable, and irreversible denuclearization of North Korea. The U.S. alliances with these two countries are absolutely ironclad. Minister Kang and Minister Kono and I have developed a close friendship, and together we will continue to closely coordinate with respect to North Korea as we move forward together.


	President Trump has also made it clear that if Kim Jong-un denuclearizes, there is a bright future for North Korea and its people. He outlined that vision beautifully here in Seoul when he spoke at the national assembly last November. We envision a strong, connected, secure, and prosperous North Korea that is fully integrated within the community of nations. Kim Jong-un indicated in Singapore that he shared that vision. We are eager to see him take the next steps to achieve it because the United States is ready for a new chapter in our history. Thank you.


MODERATOR: Thank you, Secretary Pompeo. Now we would like to invite Foreign Minister Kono to begin his opening statement.


FOREIGN MINISTER KONO: First of all, I would like to express my gratitude to Minister Kang Kyung-wha for hosting this trilateral foreign ministers meeting immediately after the first U.S.-North Korea summit in Singapore. This is the first trilateral meeting since Secretary Mike Pompeo assumed the current position. Minister Kang and I are pleased to welcome Secretary Pompeo to join us.


	Today I will also like to thank Secretary Pompeo for providing us with a timely and firsthand briefing of the summit meeting where Chairman Kim Jong-un committed to the complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. Taking this opportunity, I will like to express my heartfelt respect for the strong leadership of President Trump and hard work by Secretary Pompeo. This is only the beginning of a challenging yet significant process to achieve our common goal – peace and stability in the region and beyond through North Korea’s complete, verifiable, and irreversible dismantlement of all weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missiles of all ranges.


	Following Secretary Pompeo’s briefing, we had a frank discussion on how we urge North Korea to take concrete actions toward the full implementation of the relevant United Nations Security Council resolutions based on the outcome of the summit. We all reaffirmed that the three countries continue our joint effort to this end.


	With regard to security guarantees to North Korea, in the joint statement North Korea reaffirmed its commitment to complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, while the United States is committed to provide the security guarantee to North Korea. We understand that the United States will advance the discussion on provision of security guarantees while carefully monitoring whether North Korea takes concrete steps to fulfill its commitment to denuclearization. And we also know that no security guarantees have been given yet.


	In addition, concerning U.S.-ROK exercise, we believe that the Japan-U.S. alliance as well as the deterrents based on them play an essential role in security in the Northeast Asia. With regard to the pause in U.S.-ROK exercise, the detail will be discussed between the United States and ROK. In any case, we understand that any pause in exercise is contingent upon DPRK action towards denuclearization.


	We also understand that United States maintains its commitment to defend allies and Japan-U.S. security commitment, and U.S. forces in Japan posture remain unchanged. In any case, we would like to maintain close contact with them since these issues may also affect the security of Japan and the region.


	Japan continues to seek to normalize its relations with North Korea in accordance with Japan-DPRK Pyongyang Declaration through complete comprehensively resolving outstanding issues of concern such as nuclear missile and abductees issues as well as through the settlement of unfortunate past. Japan will continue to play an important role in realizing peace and stability in Northeast Asia in close coordination with the United States and ROK. I am looking forward to further working with both Secretary Pompeo and Minister Kang Kyung-wha in the future. Thank you very much.


MODERATOR: Thank you, Foreign Minister Kono. We’d like to now invite questions from the members of the media corps. Given the time constraints, we would like to invite just one journalist from each country, the three countries, to pose questions to the foreign ministers.


	First, (inaudible) of the Chosun Daily. And please, (inaudible) the foreign minister that you would like to receive the answer from.


QUESTION: So representing the Korean media, I’d like to pose a question. My name is (inaudible) that the Korean journalists have one question each for the foreign ministers, the first of Minister Kang Kyung-wha.


	Trump – President Trump has mentioned of the postponement of the joint military exercise and possible withdrawal of the U.S. troops in Korea. Has this been coordinated previously with the Korean Government? Then, and if not, I’d like to know if this refers to the all-out exercises or part of the joint exercises. And with regards to Ulchi Freedom Guardian, the joint military exercise which is scheduled for August, there is a report by the CNN that this will be announced on the 14th of June with regards to this Ulchi Freedom exercise.


	(In English.) My second question is for Secretary Pompeo. Mr. Secretary, with all due respect, joint statement signed in Singapore lacks many details which were included in previous agreements with North Korea. For example, 26 years ago in South-North agreement in 1992, North Korea pledged it’s not to produce, maintain, use any nuclear weapons. And they also agreed not to have uranium enrichment and plutonium reprocessing facilities. And 13 years ago in 2005 in joint statements generated from Six-Party Talks, they agreed to verifiable denuclearization and promised to abandon all nuclear weapons and existing nuclear programs.


	And President Trump and you have mentioned so many times the U.S. would not repeat past mistakes, but how can you believe North Korea’s sincerity when they refuse to clarify the specific timeline and measures of denuclearization in a written form? So do you believe North Korea because North Korea mentioned some initial steps including the closure of missile engine testing sites? And how can you be sure you’re not repeating past mistakes or even making worse mistakes by allowing North Korea continue endless negotiations and try to run out the clock? And do you have specific measures in mind to verify North Korea’s denuclearization?


	(Via interpreter.) The last question is to Minister Kono. And it has been reported that Japan and North Korea a summit meeting may be held. If there are no progress seen heretofore for the nuclear, missile or abduction issues, do you plan to also forge ahead for the summit?


FOREIGN MINISTER KANG: (Via interpreter) The question posed to me, I’d like to provide you an answer. With regards to President Trump’s statement, he has held in-depth discussions with Chairman Kim Jong-un, and President Kim has made a statement after that meeting, and I think it is to strengthen the momentum that has been created between the two sides. That’s my interpretation.


	With regards to the Korea-U.S. joint military exercise, this is an issue that involves the Korea-U.S. alliance, and this regards consultations between the military authorities of the two countries, Korea and the United States, and it will be the case in the future as well. I believe that the issue of KORUS alliance is basically we have the preconditions that we would like to maintain an ironclad posture, defense postures, as an alliance. And between the three ministers this issue has not been discussed in depth, and I believe that this is an issue to be further consulted and coordinated between the military authorities of Korea and the United States.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Let me – you asked several questions there. Let me try and address them comprehensively. Three things that are worth mentioning.


	First, there is not any difference between the three ministers and our leaders up here with respect to how we are going to address the denuclearization of North Korea. The agreement that was signed made very clear that this would be the complete denuclearization and made express reference and incorporated into that the very well-done document, the Panmunjom Declaration, which itself incorporates all previous agreements between inter-Korean agreements. I think that’s important as we come to understand the agreement that was signed between the United States and North Korea.


	What happened in Singapore created an enormous opportunity, and when we refer to the mistakes of the past they were providing economic and financial relief before the complete denuclearization had taken place. That is not going to happen. President Trump made that clear not only in his press conference, but made it clear when he was with Chairman Kim Jong-un himself, that the sequence will be different this time. That’s important. It is central to the understanding.


	You suggested that there was some risk that the clock would run out and that they would delay. We believe that Chairman Kim Jong-un understands the urgency of the timing of completing this denuclearization, that he understands that we must do this quickly, and that sanctions relief – we should recall these are UN sanctions – that sanctions relief cannot take place until such time as we have demonstrated that North Korea has been completely denuclearized.


	The summit created this enormous historic opportunity for us to move forward together and fundamentally reshape the relationship between the United States and North Korea. Verification is central to that. Complete denuclearization certainly encompasses that idea very clearly. And I know each of the three of us leaders here today are tasked with making sure that we implement that in a way that is as quick and as complete as we can achieve over the coming days and weeks.


FOREIGN MINISTER KONO: (Via interpreter) For Japanese Government’s position is as stated in Japan-DPRK Pyongyang declaration that we need to have comprehensive solution of the nuclear, missile, and abduction issues and to normalize our diplomatic relations, and then to provide economic assistance to North Korea, and our position is not changed in this regard.


	And through various channels the communication between North Korea and Japan has been continued, but for the prime ministers to have a direct dialogue with North Korea it is not just having dialogue for dialogue purposes, but we need to seek the dialogue which would lead to solutions of these issues. That should be the aim and purpose of the summit. We would like to closely work with Republic of Korea and United States and also to work closely with the international community so that firmly we will be able to seek the efforts between Japan and North Korea for the abduction issue. But at this point in time, to have any direct high-level dialogue has not been planned at all between North Korea and Japan.


MODERATOR: Next question we’ll give chance to Josh from AP.


QUESTION: Thank you so much. Secretary Pompeo, President Trump, just after returning to Washington, said people can sleep well tonight because there’s, quote, “no longer a nuclear threat from North Korea.” Isn’t that premature when North Korea has just as many nuclear weapons today as it did a week ago? And do you understand why that might make your allies nervous that the Trump administration is too trusting of Kim Jong-un?


	And to Ministers Kono and Kang, have you received any assurances from Pompeo that the KCNA report is false, that the U.S. has not agreed to a phased approach where concessions are made before denuclearization is complete? Thank you.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Well, I’ll take both questions. Foreign Minister Kang obviously can answer for herself, but let me be very blunt. President Trump has been incredibly clear about the sequencing of denuclearizations and relief from the sanctions. He has been – he said this from the very beginning, he said it again to Chairman Kim, and he said it in his press conference following – following his meeting with Chairman Kim.


	With respect to your first question, the one that was actually directed to me --


QUESTION: Can you tell us what that sequencing is then since --


SECRETARY POMPEO: Yeah, I just did. I just did. We’re going to get complete denuclearization; only then will there be relief from the sanctions.


	With respect to your first question, what the President was speaking to there is the moment that we had in Singapore, the moment where for the first time an American leader sat down, a sitting American president sat down with the leader of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, and had a blunt conversation about the changes that would need to be undertaken in order for North Korea to rejoin the community of nations.


	When he talked about the reduction in threat that followed from that, it was with eyes wide open. He said this in his press conference. It could be the case that our effort will not work, but we are determined to set the conditions so that we can right this failure of decades and reset the conditions for North Koreans – for North Korea’s participation in the community of nations.


FOREIGN MINISTER KANG: Thank you. I am absolutely assured of our shared goal, our shared approach, and how we will proceed to reach complete denuclearization. I have been assured of that from day one working with Mr. Pompeo, and so I didn’t need an additional assurance today. This is a fundamental basis, a premise that we work together on.


FOREIGN MINISTER KONO: Sequence has been clear and confirmed since meeting with Secretary Pompeo, first meeting with him in a month right after he assumed the position, so there’s no doubt about it between U.S. and Japan.


MODERATOR: Thank you very much. Now we invite journalists from Japan. (Inaudible) is from the Jiji Press. Please, go ahead.


QUESTION: (Via interpreter) My name is (inaudible) from Jiji Press. I would like to raise a question on the abduction issue of the Japanese. At the U.S.-North Korea summit meeting, how was the question raised? And this is to Secretary Pompeo. And what was the response from North Korea? And if you could also share with us your impression of their communication.


	And based upon this, I would also like to ask Minister Kono: Prime Minister Abe is showing his willingness to have a direct dialogue with North Korea based upon the results of the U.S.-North Korea summit. How will Japan proceed going forward?


	To Minister Kang, how will Korean Government work with Japan on this issue?


SECRETARY POMPEO: President Trump indeed raised this issue. He raised it on more than one occasion. He has spoken at some length. I remember sitting in the Rose Garden when Prime Minister Abe and the President were both there. The President could not have been more clear about his expectations with respect to North Korea’s obligations for the return of the abductees. He has been unequivocal. He’s been very clear. He was so with Chairman Kim as well.


FOREIGN MINISTER KANG: Could I just add, because my answer is also pretty much the same.


	(Via interpreter) President Moon Jae-in has raised this issue to Chairman Kim Jong-un himself between Japan and the DPRK at bilateral level. President Moon has urged that the two sides come together for a resolution of this issue.


FOREIGN MINISTER KONO: (Via interpreter) Prime Minister Abe is saying that in his own responsibility that he is indicating his willingness to bring solution to this issue. Through various channels and routes a dialogue has been held between Japan and North Korea. But as I have said earlier, it is not that the solution will be brought about if the leaders meet. We need to have a summit meeting which would definitely lead to solution of the issue. So towards that direction we will be making the various coordination and adjustments going forward.


MODERATOR: Thank you very much. This concludes the joint press conference. Once again, the press representatives and also the three minister, thank you very much.

POLITBURO MEMBER YANG: (Via interpreter) Welcome to China. It will be a great pleasure to meet you. We spoke on the phone on 5th of May, and I was greatly impressed by the constructive approach to the China-U.S. relationship.


	Now you are making this special trip to China to brief us on the Singapore talks, which testifies to the serious commitment of President Trump and you yourself to China-U.S relations and (inaudible).


	The summit in Singapore has yielded positive results. The U.S. and the DPRK have affirmed the shared goals, a more peaceful, prosperous, and denuclearized Korean Peninsula and agreed to open a new relationship. We welcome and support this development.


	We hope the U.S. and the DPRK will take the summit as a new starting point, maintain a momentum of dialogue and consultation, accommodate each other’s legitimate concerns, and work with other parties to advance the process of denuclearization and the political settlement of the peninsula issue. China will continue to play a positive role in this process.


	Mr. Secretary, China and the United States are the largest developing and developed countries, respectively, and the world’s top two economies. A sound and steady growing China-U.S. relationship serves the fundamental interests of our two peoples. It is also what the international community expect of us.


	We hope that both sides could proceed from the shared interests of our respective people and people across the world, follow through on the consensus our two presidents reached during their meeting in Beijing, and work together to deepen strategic mutual trust and avoid strategic miscalculation, so as to ensure that China-U.S. relationship will keep moving forward along the right track.


	Once again, Mr. Secretary, welcome to Beijing.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Thank you very much. Thanks for the kind welcome. Thanks for hosting me and my team. It was very important for me to get here as quickly as I could after the Singapore summit. The successful conclusion of the denuclearization of North Korea and, importantly, the reintroduction of North Korea into the community of nations was put on a good course in Singapore. The first step was taken.


	I came here today to talk about the importance of China being a constructive participant in the next steps. It’s very important that we achieve this outcome; it’s historic. It’s important not only to the United States and North Korea but to all of the countries around it and, indeed, the entire world.


	There remains hard work. There will be difficult days. But we can’t let those get in the way of our successful achievement of the goals.

SECRETARY POMPEO: Thank you. Thank you for being such a gracious host. It is wonderful to see you again after your visit to Washington where we had a chance to spend some time together. I’m thrilled to be here for my first time as Secretary of State. I was here as a business person many, many years ago in country. I came to appreciate the talent and capabilities and wonderful nature of the people of your country. So it’s great to be here now in an official capacity.


	And now two days removed from the Singapore summit, I’m happy to share with you some of the insights that we think we gleaned, but I wanted to thank you for the kind words you had for President Trump and the work that he did to put us in this place where we now believe we have a path forward which can truly, for the first time in so many years, create peace on the peninsula.


	And there’s still a lot of work to do. There are still risks that we won’t achieve that, but I truly do believe that the world set the conditions properly and that President Trump and Chairman Kim had a wonderful meeting where they committed to working diligently towards achieving those ends that I think the world so desires.


	So we appreciate all the things you did to help put us in the place where that summit could happen, and we thank you for that. There’s still more work to be done by China and by the United States to get to the ultimate outcome.

PRESIDENT MOON: (Via interpreter.) Mr. Secretary, I’d like to welcome you on your first visit to Korea since assuming the office of the Secretary of State. Well, I would like to congratulate you for successfully holding an historic U.S.-North Korea summit as well as for adopting a very meaningful joint statement between Chairman Kim and President Trump.


	Well, there may be very conflicting views regarding the outcome of the summit, but nevertheless, I believe that the most important factor is that through this successful summit that you have been able to put all the – the people of the whole world, including the United States, South Korea, and Japan, from the fear of war – a nuclear war and – as well as the long-range missiles. So in this way I believe it was very successful. And I believe that the summit was a truly historic feat which moved us from the era of hostility towards the era of dialogue, of peace, and of prosperity.


	Well, I appreciate the fact that President Trump gave me a phone call on board the Air Force One straight after the summit to share the (inaudible) outcome of the summit meeting with me. And now that you are here in spite of great fatigue to come and share the outcome for me to witness, I very much appreciate it.


	And today I look forward to discussing with you, Mr. Secretary, among the outcome of the meeting, the – our respective evaluation of the meeting as well as how we could fully and expeditiously implement this great agreement in the days to come.


SECRETARY POMPEO: (Inaudible). Thank you so much for hosting me here. It’s wonderful to make this the very first stop and completely appropriate here at Blue House just hours after the completion of the Singapore summit.


	It’s exceptionally long (inaudible), but we could not have accomplished it without the work that you did (inaudible), the conversations that you had. The summits that you had helped to set the course, set the foundation for the opportunity for President Trump and Chairman Kim to meet and (inaudible).


	And so all that remains is a great deal of work to do, but I look forward to doing it together to ultimately bring peace to the Korean Peninsula. I am confident that we took a very good, significant step in Singapore and that our efforts, the U.S. efforts, and the efforts of the people of the Republic of Korea will enable it to achieve its objective over the coming weeks and months.

MS NAUERT: And so this will be on the record, but again, we have the meetings with Japan and South Korea tomorrow, and so we’re not going to get ahead of those.


QUESTION: So to make the most – the best use of our – most efficient use of our time, Mr. Secretary, thank you very much for talking --


SECRETARY POMPEO: Of course.


QUESTION: -- with us. My question pertains to President Trump’s decision to suspend major military exercises on the Korean Peninsula. There was a reason why these exercises have been done for all these years, according to the Pentagon, in terms of helping the U.S. practice its ability to reinforce in a crisis. Is this decision to cancel the exercises open-ended, or would you resume the exercises if you concluded the North is not engaging seriously in the talks? And can you tell, please, a little bit about the process for deciding to suspend the exercises? Did you ask for guidance from USFK, from DOD, from the South Koreans on whether and how to do this?


SECRETARY POMPEO: So I’m not going to talk to internal processes and discussions that were had. But it – the President was very clear. I was present when the discussion took place. He made it very clear that the condition precedent for the exercises not to proceed was a productive, good-faith negotiations being ongoing. And at the point it’s concluded that they are not, the President’s commitment to not have those joint exercises take place will no longer be in effect. I mean, he was unambiguous about that and how he communicated it both I think at the press conference but certainly when he was with Chairman Kim as well.


QUESTION: I want to – could – the President also talked about you being in the lead of the negotiations in the future, and also that there will be a meeting I guess at the White House next week to discuss the – how you take it forward. What are the next steps, and when will you be meeting with the North Koreans again, with Kim Yong-chol, for instance?


SECRETARY POMPEO: So on this issue it should be very clear that the President is in the lead. Having said that, I will be the person who takes the role of driving this process forward. I don’t know exactly what the timing will be for our next conversation with North Korea. I would anticipate it will be fairly quickly after we return to our home countries. I don’t know exactly what form that will take, but I’m very confident that by some time in the next week or so we will begin the engagement.


	There was a great deal of work done over days and days and days in Panmunjom that led to the discussions that took place there in Singapore for whatever it was, 70 hours or 60 hours, whatever the two sets of teams were on the ground. So there’s – not all of that work appeared in the final document, but lots of other places where there were understandings reached. We couldn’t reduce them to writing, so that means there’s still some work to do, but there was a great deal of work done that is beyond what was seen in the final document that will be the place that we’ll begin when we return to our conversations.


QUESTION: I wanted to follow up just quickly on one thing that you said to Michael. Why would the President use the term “provocative,” though, to describe the military exercises when that’s a term that often North Koreans and the Chinese use, and we've said that they are – that they’re long planned and for purposes of readiness?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Yeah. I mean, I think – I think the President was very clear. His intention here was to put us in a place where we get the opportunity to have productive conversations connected to the denuclearization of North Korea. Our mission hasn’t changed, right. A lot has been made of the fact that the word “verifiable” didn’t appear in the agreement. Let me assure you that the “complete” encompasses verifiable in the minds of everyone concerned. One can’t completely denuclearize without validating, authenticating – you pick the word.


	The President’s committed to that. He believes that having made this commitment to Chairman Kim, that so long as we were making progress and having good-faith, productive conversations that we were setting the right conditions for moving forward with those talks. I think that’s what the President was thinking of when he made that commitment to him.


QUESTION: Mr. Secretary, I wanted to ask you about “verifiable and irreversible.”


SECRETARY POMPEO: Mm-hmm.


QUESTION: You said – the day before you said it’s our only objective, our – it’s clear we want that. It’s not in the statement. Why it’s not in the statement? And the President said it will --


SECRETARY POMPEO: Mm-hmm, it’s in the statement. It’s in the statement. You’re just wrong about that.


QUESTION: How is it in the statement? And I am also --


SECRETARY POMPEO: You’re just – because “complete” encompasses verifiable and irreversible. It just – I suppose we – you could argue semantics, but let me assure you that it’s in the document.


QUESTION: And the President said it will be verified.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Of course it will.


QUESTION: Can you tell us a little bit more about --


SECRETARY POMPEO: Of course it will. I mean --


QUESTION: -- what is – what discussed about how?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Just so you know, you could ask me this – I find that question insulting and ridiculous and, frankly, ludicrous. I just have to be honest with you. It’s a game and one ought not play games with serious matters like this.


QUESTION: But how will it be verified? Did you discuss that? Do you have --


SECRETARY POMPEO: Oh, we’re – they’re – the modalities are beginning to develop. There’ll be a great deal of work to do. It’s – there’s a long way to go, there’s much to think about, but don’t say silly things. No, don’t, don’t. It’s not productive. It’s not productive to do that, to say silly things. It’s just – it’s unhelpful.


QUESTION: Well, I think --


SECRETARY POMPEO: It’s unhelpful for your readers, your listeners, for the world. It’s – because it doesn’t remotely reflect the American position or the understandings that the North Koreans have either.


QUESTION: We’re just trying to understand how it reflects what you asked that --


SECRETARY POMPEO: Yeah, and I just articulated that for you.


QUESTION: Okay.


QUESTION: Can I – just to help him with his question and as a question, the – a big issue is you – I think you identified yourself as been the pace at which --


SECRETARY POMPEO: Yeah, yeah.


QUESTION: -- dismantlement might occur with the North, preferring a phased and somewhat prolonged approach and President Trump emphasized the need for rapid nuclear dismantlement. That issue is not illuminated in the document. In your private talks, have you had closure on that, and how and where does that stand?


SECRETARY POMPEO: I’m not going to give any insight into where we are on private talks. You should know that that will be my practice every day we’re in conversations with them.


QUESTION: I would just – Mr. Secretary, in Francesca’s defense, I would say that you’ve been very specific on this idea of CVID.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Mm-hmm.


QUESTION: But the language in the document itself, if we’re to take that at face value, North Korea makes no commitment in that – in that document that they have not made – that they have not made many times before.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Mm-hmm.


QUESTION: So the language is important and we want to be able to get a real sense for what exactly North Korea agreed to, and that leads to my question, which is: There is some skepticism about that given that KCNA now is saying that President Trump agreed on a step-by-step approach which seems to be inconsistent with what you had demanded previously. Are you concerned about the messaging coming out of North Korea that maybe they have a different idea of what was agreed to at the summit? And then we also had the President who got off the plane and said there is no longer a nuclear threat in North Korea, even though they haven’t given up their weapons yet.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Well, I’m not concerned about what was communicated to the North Koreans and what I understand them to believe given the conversations – multiple conversations, not just the time with President Trump but certainly that time with President Trump. But I had had two conversations with Chairman Kim before that as well, I’ve spent even more hours with that – with Kim Yong-chol. I am confident that they understand what we’re prepared to do, a handful of things we’re likely not prepared to do. And you began your question with the same question that was asked earlier. I am equally confident they understand that there will be in-depth verification.


QUESTION: Was the North account of the meeting accurate when they said that President Trump had agreed to a phased approach?


SECRETARY POMPEO: I’m going to leave the content of our discussions as between the two parties, but one should heavily discount some things that are written in other places --


QUESTION: Can I ask one verification question?


SECRETARY POMPEO: -- including from some of your colleagues.


QUESTION: (Laughter.) Fair.


QUESTION: Well, I was just asking about your interlocutors, the North.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Yes, and I know exactly what was said.


QUESTION: The President also mentioned that North Koreans had destroyed test sites, including the missile engine test site. Have we been able to verify the depth of the destruction and whether or not there are permanent – permanently destroyed?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Yeah, the answer is: I can only answer that we do have a reasonably good understanding of what took place there and – but I don’t want to get into the intelligence assessment. We’ve spent – I don’t want to over – a reasonable amount of time developing our understanding of what took place there. It’s always the case that our strong preference would be to have experts on the ground when these types of things take place; we gain a much more thorough understanding of what actually occurred and what may not have.


QUESTION: Would you like to accomplish major nuclear disarmament before President Trump’s first term in office ends? Is that your objective?


MS NAUERT: This is the last question.


QUESTION: Well, let him do the last one because I --


SECRETARY POMPEO: Make sure – make sure – could you ask the question one more time? Because it seems very obvious to me. The question seems – the answer almost speaks for itself.


QUESTION: Well, the --


SECRETARY POMPEO: So maybe I’m missing --


QUESTION: I don’t know. I’m not in the administration.


SECRETARY POMPEO: -- so maybe there’s something I’m missing.


QUESTION: I can’t speak for the administration, but --


QUESTION: Well, maybe have you set any deadline by which --


QUESTION: Yeah.


QUESTION: -- time the North Koreans must have done --


QUESTION: And would you like those major steps to be taken in the next two years?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Oh, yes, most definitely, absolutely. With respect to timelines, I don’t want to get into that. There is a public timeline that’s been – been out there, right – the North Koreans and the South Koreans have spoken of timeframes. The President has said, and it’s common knowledge, the work itself takes some amount of time. We have big teams ready to go. We’ve been working on it for months to have all of the relevant parties from our labs, smartest folks – by the way, not just Americans, but partners around the world. We’re prepared to execute this once we’re in position that we can actually get to a place where we can do it. So I’m confident that the long pole in the tent will be our capacity to negotiate to that place, but I’m hopeful we can move that forward fairly quickly as well.


QUESTION: So absolutely for --


SECRETARY POMPEO: Yeah, so most certainly in the President’s first term.


QUESTION: Well, and I'm sorry, what did it refer to?


MS NAUERT: Guys, the Secretary has to go. Guys.


QUESTION: And what in the President’s full term?


SECRETARY POMPEO: As you said, I hope we’ll see – you used the term major – “major disarmament,” something like that. Yes, we’re hopeful that we can achieve that in the next – what is it – two and a half years, something like that.


QUESTION: You’re hopeful, but have you set a deadline for the North Koreans?


SECRETARY POMPEO: We’re hopeful we get it done. There’s a lot of work left to do.


QUESTION: Thank you.


MS NAUERT: All right. Thank you, everybody.


QUESTION: Thank you very much.


SECRETARY POMPEO: All right. Thanks, everybody.


QUESTION: Thank you, sir.


SECRETARY POMPEO: You all have a good night.

MS SANDERS: Good afternoon. Thank you so much for your patience. It’s certainly worth the wait. Welcome to Singapore and the filing center here. We’ll keep this short.


	I’d like to welcome the Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, who will answer questions specific to the summit that will take place tomorrow. And we’ll be around to follow up with other questions beyond that. Thanks so much.


	Mr. Secretary.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Good afternoon. I want to give an update in advance of President Trump’s summit with Chairman Kim Jong Un. As the President said on Saturday, this is truly a mission of peace.


	This afternoon, the President called Prime Minister Abe of Japan and President Moon of South Korea. Earlier today, our Ambassador, Sung Kim, led a delegation to meet with Vice Foreign Minister Choe Son Hui and his North Korean -- or excuse me, her North Korean delegation. The talks continue this afternoon, even as we sit here now. They’re, in fact, moving quite rapidly. And we anticipate they will come to their logical conclusion even more quickly than we had anticipated.


	Before discussing the summit, I want to address a report in The New York Times that suggested that the U.S. team lacks the technical expertise on dismantling North Korea’s weapons program as part of these talks. I want to address that report directly.


	For over three months, an interagency working group of over 100 experts across government has met multiple times per week to address technical and logistical issues associated with dismantling North Korea’s weapons programs. They include experts from the military charged with dismantling nuclear weapons; the Department of Energy, including PhDs and experts from DOE labs; and officials from the intelligence community covering North Korea. Those same experts also cover North Korea’s nuclear, chemical, biological, and missile programs.


	These experts include dozens of PhDs who have expertise in nuclear weapons, the fuel cycle, missiles, chemical and biological weapons. They have advanced degrees in nuclear engineering, physics, chemistry, aerospace, biology, and other relevant fields.


	On the ground in Singapore, we have a team that includes the President’s senior most expert in weapons of mass destruction who can cover any technical needs that the meetings may present.


	Any suggestion that the United States somehow lacks the technical expertise across government or lacks it on the ground here in Singapore is mistaken.


	North Korea has previously confirmed to us its willingness to denuclearize, and we are eager to see if those words prove sincere. The fact that our two leaders are sitting down face to face is a sign of the enormous potential to accomplish something that will immensely benefit both of our peoples and the entire world.


	President Trump believes that Kim Jong Un has an unprecedented opportunity to change the trajectory of our relationship and bring peace and prosperity to his country. We are hopeful this summit will have set the conditions for future productive talks. In light of how many flimsy agreements the United States has made in previous years, this President will ensure that no potential agreement will fail to adequately address the North Korean threat.


	The ultimate objective we seek from diplomacy with North Korea has not changed. The complete and verifiable and irreversible denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula is the only outcome that the United States will accept. Sanctions will remain until North Korea completely and verifiably eliminates its weapons of mass destruction programs. If diplomacy does not move in the right direction -- and we are hopeful that it will continue to do so -- those measures will increase.


	President Trump recognizes Chairman Kim’s desire for security, and is prepared to ensure that a North Korea free of weapons of mass destruction is also a secure North Korea. The President has also expressed his openness to expanding access to foreign investment and other economic opportunities for North Korea if they take the right steps.


	All the preparations for the summit have come together very nicely. The President met this afternoon with Minister Lee of Singapore. It was an important opportunity to thank the Prime Minister of Singapore for his partnership in helping make this summit a reality. Singapore is home to over 4,000 American companies and is a longstanding commercial partner, and we thank them for their help in making this summit what it is.


	The President also had a chance to visit with our embassy team here in Singapore and thank them for their tireless work to make this summit a success. For example, at tomorrow’s summit, there will be some 5,000 members of the media from all over the world that will be covering this historic event.


	President Trump is going into this meeting with confidence, a positive attitude, and eagerness for real progress. He has made it clear that if Kim Jong Un denuclearizes, there is a brighter future for North Korea. Tomorrow, we will get our clearest indication to date of whether Chairman Kim Jong Un truly shares this vision.


	I’m happy to take a couple questions.


MS SANDERS: Mark Landler, New York Times.


QUESTION: Mr. Secretary, you said a moment ago that what you're aiming for is comprehensive, verifiable, and irreversible denuclearization on the Korean Peninsula. And I wondered whether that represents a slight shift in what your position had been, because traditionally you've talked just about CVID, and now you’re actually adding the phrase “on the Korean Peninsula,” which reflects in part what the North Koreans seek, which is to denuclearize the Peninsula. Is that a shift in your position?


SECRETARY POMPEO: There’s no shift in the policy. It is the case that we are prepared to make security assurances necessary for the North Koreans to engage in that denuclearization. That is, we’re prepared to take actions that will provide them sufficient certainty that they can be comfortable that denuclearization isn’t something that ends badly for them. Indeed, just the opposite: that it leads to a brighter, better future for the North Korean people.


MS SANDERS: Major Garrett, CBS News.


QUESTION: Following up on that point, Mr. Secretary, under the umbrella of security assurances, would that include removing U.S. forces now in South Korea? Is that something you’re prepared to discuss with the North Koreans directly?


SECRETARY POMPEO: I’m not going to get into any of the details of the discussions that we’ve had to date. I can only say this: We are prepared to take what will be security assurances that are different, unique than have been provided -- that America has been willing to provide previously. We think this is both necessary and appropriate.


QUESTION: Would it be erroneous to assume that that’s not on the table?


SECRETARY POMPEO: You shouldn’t assume from the fact that I don’t give any detail here today that some question you posited has any merit.


QUESTION: But you know the sensitivity --


SECRETARY POMPEO: Yeah, you should -- you should just -- if you hypothesize something that’s in it, and I refuse to tell you what’s in it, you should assume that I’m simply refusing to tell you what’s in it, and not drawing any conclusions from the negative inference that I think you’re suggesting.


	You should -- you should know there’s going to be a lot of work left to do. There’s a lot of detail that’s got to be provided. We are not going to conduct these negotiations in the open with the media; we’re going to conduct them between the two parties so that we have an opportunity to have a real success here.


MS SANDERS: Michael Gordon, Wall Street Journal.


QUESTION: Mr. Secretary, it’s clear what the U.S. expects from the North, in terms of denuclearization, but sometimes there's been a suggestion from North Korean officials that their concept of denuclearization might preclude the deployment of dual-capable aircraft on the Korean Peninsula, or even movement of aircraft carriers -- U.S. aircraft carriers -- toward the Korean Peninsula. Is this something that the Trump administration would be willing to discuss? Or is it something you can rule out? And do you hope to have a framework tomorrow that does more than just repeat the formulations used, dating 12 or 13 years ago, about denuclearization, but commits each side to taking specific steps?


SECRETARY POMPEO: So I think the first part of your question is the same question Major Garrett asked. It was a substantive question about what one side or the other may be prepared to do, and I’m simply not going to speak to that.


	With respect to the second question, the context for these discussions is radically different than ever before. The backdrop against which these negotiations are taking, President Trump has said, in a way that is fundamentally different than before.


	The President has made very clear: Until such time as we get the outcome that we’re demanding, economic relief is not going to be provided. That’s different. There was always this hypothesis that somewhere along the way, the Americans would take their foot off and allow those economic opportunities for the North, and thereby reduce the capacity to actually achieve the deal. We’re not going to do that. So these discussions that it will take place tomorrow between Chairman Kim and President Trump will set the framework for the hard work that will follow.


	And we’ll see how far we get, but I am very optimistic that we will have a successful outcome from tomorrow’s meeting between these two leaders. It’s the case, in each of those two countries, there are only two people that can make decisions of this magnitude. And those two people are going to be sitting in a room together tomorrow.


MS SANDERS: Catherine Lucey with the AP.


QUESTION: Secretary, the President says he’ll know within a minute whether Kim is serious based on his “feel.” These are obviously incredibly complex nuclear issues that have tens of millions of civilians in the crosshairs. Is it wise for the President to be going on his gut? And have you established any specific criteria for the conditions that lead him to walk out tomorrow?


SECRETARY POMPEO: The President is fully prepared for the meeting tomorrow. I have personally had the opportunity to make sure that he’s had a chance to hear lots of different voices, all of the attendant opportunities and risks, and that we have put these two leaders in the right place.


	As I said in answer to the previous question, President Trump has truly laid out a process here that is fundamentally different than the ones that we’ve gone through before. And I expect that the process from tomorrow forward will also be fundamentally different, with a resolved America working to try and provide an outcome that benefits both countries. That’s different than what we’ve done before.


QUESTION: Can you tell us anything about the preparations, sir?


MS SANDERS: Jon Decker with Fox Radio.


QUESTION: Thank you, Secretary Pompeo. The last time that you took questions from us was in the White House press briefing room, and I had an opportunity at that time to ask you a question. The question I asked you is whether or not -- or how can you trust the North Korean leader, Kim Jong Un. And I wasn't necessarily satisfied with your answer. I'd like to get your answer this time.


	But I also want to flip the question, if I may, Mr. Secretary. How can Kim Jong Un trust the United States? And I say that after what happened at the G7 Summit, when many leaders of the G7 believe that the leadership of the United States cannot be trusted as it relates to what happened with the communiqué. So perhaps you can answer both of those questions. Thank you.


SECRETARY POMPEO: I'll take your second question one first. I think the hypothesis is ludicrous. The United States has been fooled before -- there's no doubt about it. Many Presidents previously have signed off on pieces of paper, only to find that the North Koreans either didn't promise what we thought they had or actually reneged on their promises.


	The ""V"" matters. The ""V"" matters. We are going to ensure that we set up a system sufficiently robust that we're able to verify these outcomes. And it's only once the ""V"" happens that we'll proceed apace. Right? That's what's been missed before. You know, we can go back to Reagan, ""trust but verify.""


	At the end of the day, both countries are going to have to come to have sufficient trust in each other and to do the verification that each country needs that we've provided the things that are called for that we commit to in the various documents that we sign, both tomorrow, if we sign a document and if we sign subsequent documents. But we'll each have to ensure that we do the things, we take the actions necessary to follow through on those commitments. And when we do, we'll have a verified deal. And if we can get that far, we will have had a historic change here in Southeast Asia, North Asia, and all around the world.


MS SANDERS: We'll take one last question. Phil Rucker, Washington Post.


QUESTION: Mr. Secretary, this morning at his hotel in Singapore, President Trump had harsh words for Prime Minister Trudeau. And what are you doing, as the country's top diplomat, to repair relationships with our country's oldest allies -- closest allies in Europe? And do you agree with the statement made by one of your administration colleagues yesterday that there's a special place in hell for the Canadian Prime Minister?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Well, I came here today, here in Singapore, to talk about North Korea. But I'm happy to talk about work with our European partners as well. We wouldn't be in this place, we wouldn't have this historic opportunity, without the diplomatic work that's been done by our European partners alongside of us.


	President Trump has led an enormous coalition, including those very same European partners, those G7 partners to which you refer, who have helped us get to this point. I have every expectation that they will continue to do that.


	There are always irritants in relationships. I am very confident the relationships between our countries -- the United States and those G7 countries -- will continue to move forward on a strong basis. I'm unconcerned about our capacity to continue to do what we need to do to get the outcome we're looking for in North Korea as a result of what you described having taken place in Canada.


MS SANDERS: Thank you.

QUESTION: President Trump just said the United States could absolutely sign an agreement with North Korea to end the Korean War, but last week he just said he’s not going to sign anything during the summit. So could you please clarify this? And what more concrete result can we expect from the summit?


SECRETARY POMPEO: So President Trump has been very clear all along that he is prepared to provide North Korea with the security assurances, the warm political relationships that they want and are demanding in exchange for actions by North Korea, the denuclearization of the peninsula. The exact timing and the exact modalities of that occurring are yet to be agreed to, but the President is willing to do something big, something bold. I think that Chairman Kim Jong-un is prepared to do that as well. And then along with our partners – China, Japan, South Korea – we can all move forward together and have a fundamental shift in the relationship between North Korea and its region, and frankly, North Korea and the world.


QUESTION: China is a signed party of the 1953 Korean Armistice Agreement. There are some concerns in China arguing that without China’s participation any agreement to end the Korean War is invalid. What is your take on that? And is there a role for China to play in this process?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Well, I’m very confident that China will play a role. Indeed, they have already to date. They’ve been important partners in the pressure campaign, right? They’ve done things that they’ve never agreed to do before to encourage Chairman Kim and the North Koreans to consider whether they’re prepared to make a flip, right? They’ve relied historically on their nuclear program to provide their security, and what we’re asking them to do is to stand that on its head, to understand that it’s actually the possession of those nuclear weapons that create the greatest risk to North Korea. And so China has already been part of it in discussions between Chairman Kim and President Xi.


	So yes, China will certainly have a part. The first step, however, will take place on June 12th, where President Trump and Chairman Kim will have a chance to meet and begin what we hope is a successful march towards the denuclearization of the peninsula.


QUESTION: If the summit turns out to be a historic, successful meeting as you planned, can we expect sanctions to be lifted immediately right after the summit?


SECRETARY POMPEO: The President has been very clear: Sanctions will not be lifted until such time as the denuclearization itself has been completed. Look, we’ve been down the path before where promises have been made and not kept. That would be unacceptable; President Trump is not prepared to take that deal. We are prepared to do many things, but the economic sanctions themselves cannot be lifted until such time as we have confidence that the peninsula has been denuclearized.


QUESTION: And you are going to China after the – you’re going to China after the summit?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Yes.


QUESTION: What’s your vision for Chinese-U.S. relationship going forward (inaudible)? And does the trade dispute actually affect your diplomatic engagement with China?


SECRETARY POMPEO: So a couple things. First, I’m very much looking forward to my trip to Beijing. I’ve been to Beijing many times in my life before, before I entered government, so I’m looking forward to returning. I’m looking forward to meeting with China’s senior leaders to talk about exactly the relationship between our two countries. They are two big economies, two important places in the world, and we have lots of connectivity, and there are places we have challenges.


	You mentioned trade in particular. President Trump is committed to rebalancing the trade relationship between the two countries. He has sent our Secretary of Treasury, our Secretary of Commerce. Chinese economic leaders have traveled to the United States to begin to work on how – what that might look like and how that change might take place. And so I am sure we’ll talk about that too, but my real mission there is to go do two things: one, to share with them how the meetings went between President Trump and Chairman Kim Jong-un; but also to meet with them in my first trip as Secretary of State to China.


QUESTION: Do you see China as a strategic competitor or as a partner to cooperate on most issues?


SECRETARY POMPEO: It’s complicated to put an English word on this. There are many places where China and the United States will do great things together. There are other places where the two countries are competing, and they present challenges to each other. Our job as diplomats – mine as the Secretary of State and my Chinese counterparts – is to work so that it’s not a zero-sum game between our two countries, where we can succeed together.


QUESTION: The last two question --


MS NAUERT: Last question, last question.


QUESTION: When you met Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi in – at – actually, at the State Department --


SECRETARY POMPEO: Here in Washington, yes, ma’am.


QUESTION: Yes. You committed to “one China” policy, and you said U.S. policy towards Taiwan hasn’t changed. So will you allow Taiwanese leader Tsai Ing-wen to make the planned transit through United States this August?


SECRETARY POMPEO: So what I can say is this: The United States has had a long, very consistent policy with respect to how we address Taiwan. In the Trump administration, that policy is based on a longstanding set of U.S.-agreed-to principles. That policy hasn’t changed in our administration, and I don’t expect it to.


QUESTION: Thank you very much, Secretary Pompeo, for your time.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Thank you very much.

QUESTION: Actually, my first question is: Today, President Trump said he is totally prepared for the – this upcoming summit, but there is some speculations that the U.S. and North Korea have still not prepared to iron out about the CVID and a few issues. So people say that this time that both side want some just broad framework, not specifically (inaudible) steps. So what is your comment on this?


SECRETARY POMPEO: So President Trump has made clear that it is not likely that this will all fall away in a single meeting. He’s talked about that consistently. And in fact, there has been a great deal of work already done, so much preparation done by our team as well as preparation by President Trump. He is ready to meet Chairman Kim Jong-un and talk about this incredibly historic opportunity to truly, fundamentally change the relationship between North Korea and the world – importantly between North and South Korea, but fundamentally between North Korea and the world – and provide the security assurances that they need such that they are comfortable that denuclearization is something that they can achieve.


QUESTION: Can we expect some joint communique or written statement about the U.S. and North Korea statement about the CVID or the (inaudible)?


SECRETARY POMPEO: We’ll have to see how the summit proceeds. As President Trump has said, it could be that the summit won’t be successful. It could be that there – ultimately there is not an agreement between the two leaders. But in the event that we are successful as we are hopeful that we will be, yes, I would hope that there would be a statement that they would put out that each could agree to. But we’ll have to see. President Trump has said repeatedly he’s prepared to make big changes and to undertake bold action; and if Chairman Kim Jong-un is prepared to do that, so is the United States of America.


QUESTION: First phase of denuclearization does the U.S. want North Korea to ship some nuclear warhead or ICBM oversea within six months or – and do you have to agree to – I mean, do they have to agree to report or get some inspection for the undeclared nuclear site to get relief, sanction relief?


SECRETARY POMPEO: So I don’t want to get too far into the details, but when you think about complete denuclearization, it would certainly be all of their sites, not just those that have been declared, right? So we’ve got to make sure that it’s complete. That takes a great deal of work, a great big commitment on the part of North Korea as well, and there’ll be a parallel set of security assurances that are also big and bold and different.


	What’s important here is that this has been tried many times before. The challenge to denuclearize North Korea for the world is longstanding, and the problem has only grown worse. President Trump is committed to putting together an effort where the two leaders can make a decision that is good for both their countries and the world.


QUESTION: President Trump said that there could be declarations of a end of war at this meeting, so is it means the declarations with U.S. and North Korea, or could it be possible by the – through this three-way summit between Trump, Moon, and Kim?


SECRETARY POMPEO: So the summit is between the United States and North Korea, but the ultimate resolution of the problem will take lots of willing partners. Certainly, North Korea will have to make decisions, so will the United States, and so will China. North Korea has already made a number of decisions, and it’ll have to do more. Japan, too, will be central to the ultimate resolution here, because if you remember what we’re ultimately looking for, we’re looking for a safe, secure, and prosperous North Korea. That will only happen when its neighbors, the people in its region, are prepared to do the things that only they can do to make North Korea safe, secure, and prosperous.


QUESTION: (Inaudible) denuclearization steps U.S. could establish a liaison office between Washington and Pyongyang and the – start negotiations to normalize your relationship?


SECRETARY POMPEO: So some of that will – discussion will start to take place very quickly, I would imagine. But remember what we’re looking for here. It can’t be the case that it’s just a piece of paper or promises. We need to see real action. Both sides need to see real action and commitment that comes from the two leaders getting together – the only thing that could potentially lead to those kinds of actions.


QUESTION: What was the – I’m so sorry, I’m on – just last questions. You suggested the --


MS NAUERT: One last question.


QUESTION: Yes. You suggested a strong, connected, and secured and prosperous vision of future of North Korea, so how can you achieve the visions? Is it through the financial support for North Korea, Japan, and China (inaudible)?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Yes. So it would be our expectation that the countries in the region would provide the initial financial support for just that; but over time, we would hope that, much like the other countries in the region, it would be able to achieve exactly what I described – a connected, safe, secure North Korea without outside assistance. It would be the opening up of the country, it would be their connectedness, it would be their ability to prosper on their own feet. The North Korean people are industrious people and they’re quite capable, and so we would hope that their – while it may take resources at the front end to assist them to move in that direction, but we have great confidence in the North Korean people to achieve this themselves over some period.


QUESTION: What about the --


MS NAUERT: Thank you. Thank you.


QUESTION: -- (inaudible) sector’s investment from U.S.?


MS NAUERT: Thank you. I’m so sorry.


SECRETARY POMPEO: We’re happy to share with them. We’re happy to share with them technology, knowledge, entrepreneurship, efforts to build systems. Those are the kind of things that we think America can uniquely provide, and I am confident President Trump is prepared to allow that to happen if we get to the right place. Thank you.

QUESTION: So first of all, in principle, what’s your hope for the U.S.-North Korean foreign summit, and how confident are you that North Korean leader Kim Jong-un will accept the same definition of denuclearization of the U.S., which is CVID?


SECRETARY POMPEO: So I’ve had the chance to meet with Chairman Kim Jong-un, and I have also been working on this for a long time, as have many members of the United States Government. Our objective for the summit is very clear: We want to achieve a fundamentally different strategic relationship between our two countries. We are – we believe it’s important to (inaudible) completely denuclearize North Korea.


	In exchange for that, we’re prepared to do things that provide them the security assurances that they need and the warmer political relationship that they need as well. We’re hoping to make just as much progress on that as we can during the summit, and we believe that the two leaders sitting down together offers the world a great opportunity.


QUESTION: What kind of actions for denuclearization will you expect that Mr. Kim will commit at the summit?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Well, we’ll have to see. We don’t know how far the two leaders will be able to get. We are optimistic, though, having had a chance to work – we’ve had teams working in Panmunjom. We’ve had teams working in Singapore. We’ve been in communications back and forth between our two governments for many, many months now. So we’ve been working to lay a foundation so that the two leaders can get as far as they can in the time that they have together.


QUESTION: What’s your vision for the timeline of the denuclearization?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Yes, I don’t want to talk about timelines. The two leaders will certainly discuss that. There have been discussions around this very issue already. We need to see how far we can get, how much progress can be made, in the hours that we have together in Singapore.


QUESTION: But do you think that Mr. Kim has already made a strategic decision to abandon all nuclear weapons?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Well, this is why the two leaders are meeting, right? Chairman Kim told me directly that he was prepared to sit with President Trump and talk about how that denuclearization would take place. The two of them will have a chance to have an extensive conversation surrounding that. So we’ll leave plenty of space for the two leaders to move forward and for them each to make decisions about how their country (inaudible).


	Chairman Kim’s got to make a big strategic decision. He has historically believed that his nuclear program provided security for his country, and to shift that to believe that security will come from a good relationship with the United States and the world is a big shift. We’re very hopeful that he’ll see it the way our President does. Our President is firmly prepared to make sure that Chairman Kim and the North Korean people will live in (inaudible) and with the security assurances that they are demanding.


QUESTION: So what kind of security assurances will you be prepared to offer Kim Jong-un? Are you making a peace deal?


SECRETARY POMPEO: So the presidents – the two leaders are going to talk. We’re not going to talk about the details of the negotiating. We’re not going to negotiate in advance of it. We’ll let the two leaders get together, and they’ll begin to flesh out what both the security assurances will look like, what we can do together politically to provide better relations between our two countries, and then talk about denuclearizations.


QUESTION: How about the economic assistance? President Trump made a statement that it will be China – Japan, China, South Korea will provide economic assistance. How is it important for denuclearization, having the Japanese economic assistance?


SECRETARY POMPEO: So it’s very important, and these concepts are incredibly linked. For North Korea to have the security assurances it needs, it needs to know that it has an economic – economically viable path forward. It has to know that its people can eat and that they can have the wealth that the North Korean people so richly deserve. So these are very closely linked issues; it’s difficult to separate them out. And so not only Japan, but South Korea, China – I imagine many nations will want to participate in the North Korean economy if we are successful in Singapore.


QUESTION: But Japanese Government is saying that they are not ready to provide economic assistance until all issues are resolved, such as the abductee issue. At what point do you expect Japan to provide economic assistance?


SECRETARY POMPEO: So, much like the economic opening that will take place, it will only take place at such time as we have completed the denuclearization. So there are other things that can go along in parallel, but the economic relief, the sanctions relief that President Trump spoke about earlier today, can’t take place until we see real action, real change, on the part of North Korea. And the Japanese economic support wouldn’t come until that was – that had occurred as well.

SANDERS: Good afternoon. Thanks for being patient with us. Obviously, there’s a great deal of interest on the upcoming summit with the North Koreans. We have Secretary Pompeo here, who will make some brief opening remarks and then take questions on that topic. As you know, the President has already done a press conference today, so we’ll keep questions limited to that. And we’ll be around the rest of the day to answer other news of the day.


Thanks. With that, Mr. Secretary.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Thanks, Sarah.


QUESTION:  Sarah, are you going to take questions after (inaudible)?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Yes, I’m going to take a couple questions. (Laughter.) A couple. Good afternoon. It’s great to be joining you all here today. Early in his presidency, President Trump made a commitment to address the threat of North Korea, which has been a threat to our nation for far too long.


President Trump has been, and continues to be, committed to ridding the United States and the world of threats posed by North Korea’s weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missile programs. These programs threaten our homeland, our allies and partners, and the broader non-proliferation regime. North Korea’s past activities also make clear that it is proliferation to other actors that creates a risk, in addition to the primary risks. It has supporting infrastructure that is also of concern.


In early 2017, the Trump administration decided on a policy we have referred to as the “maximum pressure campaign.” The campaign enacted the strongest economic and diplomatic sanctions against North Korea in history. The goal was to set the conditions for the DPRK to make a strategic decision to denuclearize as the best means by which it will achieve its own security.


American leadership rallied the international community to send a strong message to Chairman Kim Jong Un and the world that we would not stand for the DPRK’s illegal weapons programs. The President’s bold decision to meet with Chairman Kim Jong Un grew from this incredibly strong and targeted campaign. The President’s policy directly led to the historic summit that will take place on June 12th in Singapore.


Back on March 8th, Chairman Kim Jong Un expressed his desire to meet with President Trump as soon as possible. And then on May 9th, I met with Chairman Kim Jong Un in Pyongyang and explained America’s expectations for denuclearization.


At that time, we also secured the release of three Americans: Kim Dong-chul, Tony Kim, and Kim Hak-song. We view this as a sign of goodwill from Chairman Kim Jong Un.


The United States and North Korea have been holding direct talks in preparation for a summit, and North Korea has confirmed to us its willingness to denuclearize. A comprehensive whole-of-government effort in support of President Trump’s upcoming summit is under way. White House- and State Department-led advance teams are finalizing logistical preparations and will remain in place in Singapore until the summit begins. The President continues to follow every development closely, and is getting daily briefings from his national security team.


The fact that our two leaders are coming to the table shows that the two sides are very serious. The diplomatic model we’ve used to date is different from past efforts. Our efforts give us hope that we can find real success where past efforts have fallen short.


President Trump is hopeful, but he’s also going into the summit with his eyes wide open. We’ve seen how many inadequate agreements have been struck in the past. And you can be sure that President Trump will not stand for a bad deal. The United States has been clear, time and time again, that complete, verifiable, and irreversible denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula is the only outcome that we will find acceptable.


The President recognizes that North Korea has great potential, and he looks forward to a day when sanctions on the DPRK can begin to be removed. However, that cannot happen until the DPRK completely and verifiably eliminates its weapons of mass destruction programs.


President Trump and Chairman Kim will certainly also discuss security assurances for the DPRK, establishing a peace regime, and improving relations between our two countries. Until we achieve our goals, the measures that the world, alongside the United States, has put on the regime will remain. In the event diplomacy does not move in the right direction, these measures will increase. Throughout the entire process, the United States has been unified with Japan and South Korea in response to the threats from North Korea.


I will be traveling with my — excuse me, I will be traveling to meet with my Japanese and South Korean counterparts after the summit to continue to coordinate with them. I will also stop in Beijing following the Singapore summit. I’ll provide them with an update and underscore the importance of fully implementing all sanctions that are imposed on North Korea.


President Trump recognizes North Korea’s desire for security and is prepared to ensure a DPRK free of its weapons of mass destruction is also a secure North Korea.


President Trump has made it clear that if Kim Jong Un denuclearizes, there is a brighter path for North Korea and its people. We envision a strong, connected, secure, and prosperous North Korea that is integrated into the community of nations. We think that the people of the United States and North Korea can create a future defined by friendship and collaboration, and not by mistrust and fear.


We believe that Chairman Kim Jong Un shares this positive vision for the future, and we are committed to finding a path forward. And we assume and hope that that belief is sincere.


We’re looking forward to being in Singapore in just a few days.


SANDERS: As a reminder, we’ll take just a few questions before the Secretary has to depart.


Roberta.


QUESTION:  Thank you. What progress have you made in narrowing the gap in your understanding of denuclearization and North Korea’s definition of denuclearization? Has there been progress in bringing that definition closer together?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Yes.


QUESTION:  Can you describe that a little bit?


SECRETARY POMPEO: No.


(Laughter.)


SANDERS: That was quick. Jon Decker.


QUESTION:  Thank you, Sarah. Thank you, Secretary Pompeo. As you mentioned in your remarks, North Korea, in the past, has reneged on prior agreements that it’s made with the U.S. government. So I have two questions for you. The first question has to do with your experience meeting with Kim Jong Un. Do you trust him? And my second question has to do with the negotiations that are upcoming with North Korea. Who, in your opinion, has the upper hand in the negotiations, and why?


SECRETARY POMPEO: So with respect to your first question, I’ve had the chance to meet with Chairman Kim Jong Un twice now. I can tell you he is very capable of articulating the things that he is prepared to do, present clearly the challenges that we all have to overcome. It’s why the two leaders are meeting. It’s the opportunity to lay those out clearly between the two leaders so that we can see if we can find a path forward together that achieves the outcomes that both countries want.


And your second question?


QUESTION:  Who has the upper hand in the negotiations?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Yeah. We don’t think about it in terms of who has the upper hand. We know this has been a long, intractable challenge. It’s gone on for decades. The President has said repeatedly: Previous administrations weren’t prepared to do what we’ve done already. It’s not about who has the upper hand. It’s about trying to find a way where the two sides can come to an understanding, where we can get concrete steps, not just words, that resolve this challenge.


Pamela.


QUESTION:  Mr. Secretary, first of all, the President said that he doesn’t believe he needs to prepare very much ahead of this summit. Do you think that’s a prudent approach?


And also, I want to get your reaction to Rudy Giuliani’s comments that “Kim Jong Un got back on his hands and knees and begged” for the summit to go back on — whether you think he should be weighing in on these international affairs and whether you agree with that assessment.


SECRETARY POMPEO: So back to your second question. I took him as it being a small room and not being serious about the comments. I think it was a bit in jest, and —


QUESTION:  Do you think it could jeopardize the summit or —


SECRETARY POMPEO: We’re moving forward. We’re focused on the important things. I know Rudy. Rudy doesn’t speak for the administration when it comes to this negotiation and this set of issues.


With respect to your first question, you know, progress — we’re making progress, inch by inch. And we’re going to travel there. This is different. The approach that President Trump is taking is fundamentally different. In the past, there have been months and months of detailed negotiations, and it got nowhere. This has already driven us to a place we’ve not been able to achieve before.


SANDERS: Dave Boyer.


QUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. Secretary. The President said today that if the Singapore meeting goes well, he’d like to bring Kim Jong Un to Washington, possibly, for further meetings. Has Kim Jong Un invited the President to come to North Korea?


SECRETARY POMPEO: So I don’t want to talk to you about the conversations that have been had between the North Korean side and the United States. I’ll leave that for the President to talk to.


But I do want to get to — and this comes back to the other question that you asked about the President’s preparation. So in my previous role — and I’ve said this before; you can look it up — there were few days that I left the Oval Office after having briefed the President that we didn’t talk about North Korea. So over months and months, days and days, President Trump has been receiving briefings on this issue about the military aspects of it; the commercial, economic aspects of it; the history of the relationship. And in the past few months, there have been near-daily briefings, including today, where we have been providing the President all the information that he needs. And I am very confident that the President will be fully prepared when he meets with his North Korean counterpart.


QUESTION:  Just having met the man twice now, what can you tell us about what opinions you’ve formed of Kim Jong Un as a person?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Yeah. So I haven’t spent that much time with him. What I have said publicly is he has indicated to me, personally, that he is prepared to denuclearize; that he understands that the current model doesn’t work, that he’s prepared to denuclearize.


And that, too, he understands that we can’t do it the way we’ve done it before — that this has to be big and bold, and we have to agree to making major changes. We can’t step through this over years, but rather need to acknowledge it will take some amount of time, that this doesn’t happen instantaneously. But that the model for succeeding — security assurance; and political normalization; and denuclearization completely, verifiably, and irreversibly — for that to take place, we’ve got to make bold decisions.


And I’m hopeful that Chairman Kim Jong Un is prepared to make that decision for his country. A big shift in his strategic understanding of his security.


SANDERS: Ayesha.


QUESTION:  Thank you. So you said that you — that the President is prepared to talk about security guarantees for North Korea. We have seen in this administration that you can — that when new administrations come in, they can undo things that prior administrations have done. How can President Trump guarantee long-term security for North Korea and for Kim, in particular?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Well, look, we’re going to have to do things that convince Chairman Kim that that’s the case. All right? That’s what we’ll have to do.


So let me give you an example. We are hopeful that we will put ourselves in a position where we can do something the previous administration didn’t do. Right? They signed a flimsy piece of paper, and we’re hoping to submit a document that Congress would also have a say in — that would give currency and strength and elongation to the process, so that when administrations do change, as they inevitably do, and this one will — six and half years from now — when that takes place, that Chairman Kim will have comfort that American policy will continue down the same path, on the course that we hope we’re able to set in Singapore.


SANDERS: We’ll take one last question. Zeke.


QUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. Secretary. At the top of your remarks — first, to follow up briefly on your comments just about Asia. When you say a “document” that Congress would sign off on, are you referring to a treaty?


Then second, at the top of your remarks, you said that there’s also this threat to the United States and its allies from the North Koreans’ WMDs, as well as ballistic missiles. Is that a condition for the President in any negotiation agreement with Chairman Kim, that its ballistic missile program and chemical weapons also be part of that?


And third, finally, can you discuss the format of the meeting between the President and Chairman Kim? What will it look like? Who will be there?


SECRETARY POMPEO: So I’ll leave it to the White House to talk about the format of the meetings when the time is right.


With respect to proliferation risk, it’s very real. There is a history of that, with respect to North Korea and some of our other difficult challenges in the world today. They are connected. The reason you want complete, verifiable, and irreversible is precisely that. To the extent there remain stockpiles, knowledge bases, warehouses, systems, infrastructure, fissile material production facilities — I could go on — to the extent those remain, the risk of proliferation continues. And it’s our aim, through the CVID process and providing the security assurances that Chairman Kim will want, that we can greatly reduce the risk that proliferation ever happens as a result of North Korean actions.


SANDERS: Thanks so much —


QUESTION:  One more please, Sarah.


QUESTION:  Mr. Secretary, can you explain the President’s shift — when he’s gone from talking about defining success for this meeting as denuclearization of the Peninsula, to now talking about the need for more meetings? Can you explain what happened there and why this shift? And can you also describe your disagreements over North Korea internally with the national security advisor?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Yeah, with respect to the second one, I’ve read a little bit about this. And I love good fiction as next as — as much as the next person, but it is without foundation, so much so that — I’ll be polite, since I’m a diplomat now. Suffice to say, those articles are unfounded and a complete joke.


QUESTION:  Surely, there had to be — must have been some —


SECRETARY POMPEO: Oh, sure. Ambassador Bolton and I will disagree with great, great consistency over time, I’m confident. Right? We’re two individuals. We’re each going to present our views. I’m confident that will happen on issues from how long this press conference ought to go — (laughs) — to issues that really matter to the world.


So it’s absolutely the case that Ambassador Bolton and I won’t always agree, and I think the President demands that we each give him our own views.


QUESTION:  (Inaudible.)


SECRETARY POMPEO: Yeah. So you had a first — your first question, I’ll try to answer. I’ll try to answer your first question, too. I don’t see the shift as disjunctive as you do. The President has always understood that this was a process. It’s been very clear that there would — that it would always take a great deal of work to do this.


So I think your — you can interpret it how you will, but I think your characterization of that also doesn’t reflect the President’s understanding. I think his understanding about this process has been pretty consistent since I’ve been working with him now, almost a year and a half ago.


SANDERS: Thanks so much, guys.

	We welcome the launch on Sunday of operations by the Syrian Democratic Forces against ISIS terrorists in Dashisha, Syria. Dashisha is a notorious ISIS stronghold in northeast Syria from which ISIS has terrorized the Syrian and Iraqi people for many years. These operations have been planned over many months in coordination with Iraqi forces across the border to ensure ISIS terrorists have no escape. The Department of State has been proud to lend diplomatic support through this planning process together with our Department of Defense colleagues and Coalition Partners.


	The Department of State is also focused on the phase after ISIS. We will help ensure that the Government of Iraq has the support it needs to fully secure it borders against ISIS and other terrorist threats, pursuant to our Strategic Framework Agreement with Iraq. We will also work to ensure that all the diverse people of northeast Syria, including Arabs, Kurds, Christian, and Turkmen, have an appropriate say in defining the future of Syria pursuant to the political process set forth in the UN Security Council Resolution 2254.


	The fighting over the days ahead will be extremely difficult. We have full confidence in our partners, the Syrian Democratic Forces, and we are proud to work with them to rid Syria from the scourge of ISIS and help build a better future for all Syrians. President Trump has acknowledged that there is more work to be done to complete the defeat of ISIS and he is committed to finishing the job as quickly as possible while setting the conditions that will prevent its return.


	In that regard, we continue to call on Coalition members, our regional partners, and allies to share the burden for ongoing stabilization efforts that are critical to preserving the military gains that have been achieved.

SECRETARY POMPEO: Thank you. Thank you, Secretary General Almagro and your team, for organizing this 48th General Assembly of the OAS. We are incredibly grateful for your leadership.


	It is a pleasure to be here at the OAS for the first time as Secretary of State of the United States of America, and I am delighted to meet many of my fellow foreign ministers here and today.


	I would also like to acknowledge the great work of our permanent representative, Ambassador Trujillo, and his team, and – as well as all of those – work of the perm-reps to the Organization of American States.


	Before I continue, I’d like to express our solidarity with the Guatemalan people and send our condolences to the families and loved ones of those who perished as a result of the volcano eruption in Guatemala on Sunday.


	Just as we did when this first body met 70 years ago, the United States continues to place a great deal of value on the OAS and its role in forging a hemisphere distinguished by democracy, peace, respect for human rights, and cooperation. We must all do our part to strengthen the OAS to deal effectively with the challenges to our values we face together today and, of course, those we will face in the future.


	I would like to thank our fellow member-states for their support of a decision at last year’s General Assembly to reduce the OAS’s dependence on a single member-state: mine. This is an important step rooted in increasing buy-in and burden sharing to achieve our shared goals. This year I hope that we can agreeably adopt a plan to implement this decision in order to put the OAS on more sustainable financing footing.


	As for confronting shared challenges in the region, at the Summit of the Americas our leaders agreed upon steps to combat corruption, a cancer that eats away at the underpinnings of democracy and stifles the dreams of our citizens. We must continue to improve transparency in government and public procurement, and call out and prosecute corrupt officials.


	Transnational criminal organizations kill our people, they destabilize our societies, and they challenge our democratic institutions. The United States will not stand for this. We will continue to cooperate with our Mexican counterparts and with leaders from the Northern Triangle to build on our gains in addressing the drivers of illegal immigration and the illicit trafficking.


	Our fight to crush these TCOs will continue with the implementation of the Caribbean Basin Security Initiative. We will also continue to pursue Caribbean 2020, our strategy-focused – our strategy for enhanced Caribbean engagement in the areas of security, diplomacy, prosperity, energy, education, and health.


	The natural disasters of the past year have tested our people’s resilience. The United States is proud to help OAS countries bounce back in the aftermath of such tragedies. One way we are doing this is helping small businesses in the vital Caribbean tourism industry get back on their feet again after hurricanes.


	In Cuba today, we see an expectation that change is inevitable and that it can't come quickly enough. Young Cubans born under a dictatorship are uninterested in hollow revolutionary slogans. They demand educational opportunities free from political constraints or a totalitarian regime’s repression. They want what youth everywhere else wants: opportunities to use their talents, to exercise their voice, achieve their potential, and build a bright future for themselves. As democratic societies, we must support young people in Cuba and elsewhere in the hemisphere in their hopes for democratic change.


	In Nicaragua police and government-controlled armed groups have killed dozens, merely for peacefully protesting. I echo what Vice President Pence said in this very building on May 7th: “We join with nations around the world in demanding that Ortega Government [respond] to the Nicaraguan people’s demands for the democratic reform and hold accountable those responsible for violence.” The United States supports the work of the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights and what it is doing in Nicaragua, and strongly urges the Nicaraguan Government to implement the recommendations issued by the commission this past May 21st.


	But there is no greater challenge today than the full-scale dismantling of democracy and the heartbreaking humanitarian disaster in Venezuela. While the United States welcomes the release of the unjustly imprisoned Holt family, our policy towards Venezuela remains unchanged. The United States stands steadfast in support of the Venezuelan people and their efforts to return to democracy. The Maduro regime’s efforts towards – to move towards unconstitutional government and its human rights abuses are now well known by all. All these actions have, among other ill consequences, resulted in an unconstitutional alteration of Venezuela’s constitutional order.


	Given these circumstances, we are all challenged to act under the Inter-American Democratic Charter, which this body has already begun to do.


	On more than one occasion, Venezuela has squandered opportunities to have the kind of dialogue that the charter calls for. We seek only what all the nations of the OAS want for our people: a return to the constitutional order, free and fair elections with international observation, and the release of political prisoners. The regime’s refusal to take meaningful action on these issues has demonstrated unmistakable bad faith and exhausted options for dialogue under current conditions.


	Just two weeks ago, the Venezuelan Government staged sham elections that offered no real choice to Venezuelan people and its voters. Many of them responded sensibly by simply staying home.


	For all of these reasons, Vice President Pence challenged member-states last month to do what the Democratic Charter asks of us when faced with an unconstitutional interruption in democratic order of a member-state: suspend Venezuela from this body.


	That suspension is not a goal unto itself. But it would show that the OAS backs up its words with action. And it would send a powerful signal to the Maduro regime: Only real elections will allow your government to be included in the family of nations.


	In addition to suspension, I call on fellow member-states to apply additional pressure on the Maduro regime, including sanctions and further diplomatic isolation, until such time as it undertakes the actions necessary to return genuine democracy and provide people desperately needed access to international humanitarian aid.


	We call on all OAS nations to do this today regarding Venezuela, and in the future, wherever necessary, for good of the region and the world. Thank you. (Applause.)

Through its diplomatic efforts, international engagement, and coordination on behalf of the U.S. government, the U.S. Department of State advances U.S. objectives in cyberspace to ensure that the Internet and other connected technologies remain valuable and viable tools for future generations.


	As directed by Executive Order 13800 (the cybersecurity E.O.), the Department of State worked with colleagues across the federal government to produce recommendations for the President on securing America’s cyber interests and deterring cyber adversaries by engaging international partners on these critical domestic and foreign policy imperatives.


	A year after the 2017 publication of the cybersecurity E.O., the Department is releasing two products detailing U.S. policy objectives and international engagement approaches to reduce the risk of conflict stemming from the use of cyberspace, improve the ability of the United States to deter malicious cyber actors, uphold the open and interoperable Internet, facilitate the achievement of U.S. economic prosperity, and advance an international regulatory environment that supports innovation and respects the global nature of cyberspace.


	These documents and their recommendations emphasize the importance of the Department’s and the U.S. government’s ongoing work to engage foreign partners to address a range of threats in cyberspace, thereby improving the cybersecurity of the nation. They further acknowledge the necessity of enhancing U.S. government coordination on all fronts to maximize the effectiveness of international outreach on cyber policy. The Department of State is committed to fulfilling its leadership role in this process.

SECRETARY POMPEO: Good afternoon, everyone. As you know, in addition to my meeting with Vice Chairman Kim Yong-chol, we have teams in Singapore and at the DMZ working with their North Korean counterparts to prepare for President Trump and Chairman Kim’s expected summit in Singapore. Through these series of meetings, I am confident we are moving in the right direction.


	Today, Vice Chairman Kim and I discussed how our countries could come together and take advantage of the unique opportunity that our two leaders have created through their visions of the future that they have so clearly articulated. Vice Chairman Kim Yong-chol is now planning to travel to Washington to deliver a personal letter from Chairman Kim Jong-un.


	The proposed summit offers a historic opening for President Trump and Chairman Kim to boldly lead the United States and the DPRK into a new era of peace, prosperity, and security. Our two countries face a pivotal moment in our relationship in which it could be nothing short of tragic to let this opportunity go to waste.


	In my conversations with Chairman Kim Jong-un in Pyongyang and today with Vice Chairman Kim Yong-chol, I have been very clear that President Trump and the United States objective is very consistent and well known: the complete, verifiable, and irreversible denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. President Trump has also made it clear that if Kim Jong-un denuclearizes, there is a brighter path for North Korea. We envision a strong, connected, and secure, prosperous North Korea that maintains its cultural heritage but is integrated into the community of nations.


	We think that working together, the people of the United States and North Korea can create a future defined by friendship and collaboration, not by mistrust and fear and threats. We sincerely hope that Chairman Kim Jong-un shares this positive vision for the future. We expect both leaders to enter the summit in Singapore, if it proceeds, with their eyes wide open and with a clear understanding of the possibilities for the future. If these talks are successful, it will truly be historic. It will take bold leadership from Chairman Kim Jong-un if we are able to seize this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to change the course for the world.


	President Trump and I believe Chairman Kim is the kind of leader who can make those kinds of decisions, and that in the coming weeks and months we will have the opportunity to test whether or not this is the case.


	Happy to take a couple questions.


MS NAUERT: Our first question – and one question each, please – goes to Nick Wadhams from Bloomberg. Nick, go ahead.


QUESTION: Thanks. Mr. Secretary, last night the State Department told us that the U.S. would be looking for a historic commitment from North Korea before the summit would go ahead. Today you ended talks with Kim Yong-chol early. Can you talk about why you did that? Did you get the commitment you sought and do the U.S. and North Korea now agree on what denuclearization would mean?


SECRETARY POMPEO: So that’s a (inaudible) matter. We didn’t end the talks early. We had a set series of items that we wanted to make sure we covered, topics which we made sure that we were clear on in terms of what our expectations were and their expectations in return of us. We achieved that. This is a difficult, difficult challenge. Make no mistake about it. There remains a great deal of work to do. And we made progress here as well as at the same time made progress in the other venues that conversations were taking place. We had all the time we needed today to make the progress that was achievable during our time here in New York City.


MS NAUERT: Our next question goes to Michael Gordon from The Wall Street Journal.


QUESTION: Sir, following up on that, a senior State Department official – same person who spoke to us last night – also indicated that the United States hopes to persuade North Korea that its security doesn’t depend on nuclear weapons. You’ve now had three meetings with them and spent some hours with them. Do you feel that you’ve been successful yet in doing that, or is the difficult in settling this issue the reason why President Trump is now talking about the possibility of having two or three summits and not just trying to break the back of these issues in a single meeting?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Yeah, this is – look, make no mistake about it. President Trump, this administration completely understands how hard this problem is. There is a long history where North Korea has viewed its nuclear program as providing the security that it needed for the regime. The effort now is to come to a set of understandings which convince the North Koreans of what President Trump has said. If we’re able to achieve it, if the North Koreans are prepared in fact to denuclearize – this includes all elements of their nuclear program – if we convince them of that, that in fact their security is greater, that in fact the real threat to their security is the continued holding onto of that nuclear weapons program and not the converse. We’ve had lots of conversations around that. The true test, of course, comes when we actually achieve this, but many conversations have been had about how we might proceed, what the path might be forward so that we can achieve both the denuclearization that the world demands of North Korea and the security assurances that would be required for them to allow us to achieve that.


MS NAUERT: Next one to Martha Raddatz from ABC News.


QUESTION: Secretary Pompeo, you call it a proposed summit. Will we find out whether it’s a go tomorrow? And also, you looked the vice chairman in the eyes. You have been with him in the room. What accounted for the progress? This has been such a roller coaster ride. The summit was off; we’ve gone from fire and fury to this. So talk about what accounted for the change, and do you worry that you could still change back?


SECRETARY POMPEO: So Martha, I have had the chance to meet Chairman Kim Jong-un twice and now Kim Yong-chol three times. I’ve spent a great deal of time with each of them. I believe they are contemplating a path forward where they can make a strategic shift, one that their country has not been prepared to make before. This will obviously be their decision. They’ll have to make that. They’ll have to choose – as I just spoke about, they’ll have to choose a path that is fundamentally different than the one that their country has proceeded on for decades. It should not be to anyone’s surprise that there will be moments along the way that this won’t be straightforward, that there’ll be things that look hard and times it appears there’s a roadblock and sometimes, perhaps, even perceived as insurmountable.


	Our mission is incredibly clear. It is to continue to push forward – the President has directed me to push forward to test the proposition that we can achieve that outcome. So I know everyone’s following this minute by minute and hour by hour. This is going to be a process that will take days and weeks to work our way through. There will be tough moments, there will be difficult times. I’ve had some difficult conversations with them as well. They’ve given it right back to me too. There is – we’re decades into this challenge, and so one not ought to be either surprised or frightened or deterred by moments where it looks like there are challenges and difficulties, things that can’t be bridged. Our mission is to bridge them so that we can achieve this historic outcome.


QUESTION: And on the proposed summit, will we know tomorrow whether there will actually be a summit?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Don’t know. Don’t know the answer to that.


MS NAUERT: And our final question goes to Adam Shapiro with Fox News.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Let me just say, Martha, while we may not know tomorrow, I will tell you we’ve made real progress in the last 72 hours toward setting the conditions, right – so your question really goes to what are the conditions. The conditions are putting President Trump and Chairman Kim Jong-un in a place where we think there could be real progress made by the two of them meeting. It does no good if we’re in a place where we don’t think there’s real opportunity to place them together. We’ve made real progress towards that in the last 72 hours.


MS NAUERT: And Adam from Fox.


QUESTION: Secretary Pompeo, you talk about complete denuclearization of the peninsula, so my question is about this and the impact on our allies. What concern does the United States have about exposing South Korea and our Asian allies, like Japan, to greater, perhaps, Chinese influence if there is as part of a deal in the future a draw-down of U.S. military presence in South Korea?


SECRETARY POMPEO: I’m not going to talk about today nor at any time during the negotiations about the elements of what the shape of the agreement looks like. That’s – those are things that ought to be held so that the leaders have all the freedom they need to make the right decision. So with respect to the draw-down, it’s obviously a DOD issue. I’m not going to speak to that today.


	What I can say is this: I’ve been the Secretary of State now for 30-odd days, I think. There is no daylight between the South Koreans, the Japanese, and the United States with respect to our approach to how we resolve this issue with respect to North Korea. I have spoken to my counterparts there, I’ve spoken to President Moon there. We understand their concerns. We understand the risks that can be posed to them. And an agreement that we reach will provide an outcome that each of those countries can sign on to as well.


QUESTION: But is there the potential for the creation, for lack of a better term, of a vacuum that the Chinese could then move in, whether it be economic, political, or militarily?


SECRETARY POMPEO: The Chinese are moving all around the world today. Let’s be clear. The risk of that is real everywhere, not just in this particular space. We’re keenly aware of it, and I’m – I am confident that the things we’re talking about with respect to North Korea will not enhance the risk of that to any significant degree. We wouldn’t do that to the South Koreans or the Japanese, two of our most important allies in the region.


MS NAUERT: Okay, everyone. Thank you.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Thank you very much.


MS NAUERT: Thank you so much. Good to see you.


QUESTION: Are we going to Singapore?

	Since 1971, the United States and the Independent State of Samoa have been close and enduring partners in the Pacific. Our two countries are joined by our shared belief in democracy and freedom. Together, we have partnered to further these foundational principles across the region. This work continues as we work together in the Indo-Pacific to promote democracy, expand economic opportunity and safeguard natural resources.

	Today, on the annual International Day of United Nations Peacekeepers, we mark 70 years of UN peacekeeping, and the service and sacrifice of thousands of uniformed and civilian personnel. UN peacekeepers serve under dangerous and uncertain circumstances, and too often pay the ultimate sacrifice. We honor in particular today the more than 3,700 peacekeepers who have lost their lives in the service of peace over the past seven decades.


	As we mark the past and present of UN peacekeeping, the United States is committed to a future with better, smarter peacekeeping operations that more effectively and efficiently address conflicts, support political solutions, and meet the needs of people on the ground. That commitment includes remaining the world’s top financial contributor to UN peacekeeping, as well as the leading provider of training and equipment to troop- and police-contributing countries.


	Today we recognize the powerful role peacekeeping missions have played in supporting sustainable transitions to peace in countries from Sierra Leone to Cambodia, Timor-Leste to Namibia, Liberia to Cote d’Ivoire. As President Trump affirmed during remarks at last year’s UN General Assembly, “I am confident that if we work together and champion truly bold reforms, the United Nations will emerge as a stronger, more effective, more just, and greater force for peace and harmony in the world.”

MS NAUERT: Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the State Department. Thank you for coming in so early this morning for the unveiling of the International Religious Freedom Report. I’d like to first introduce Secretary Pompeo, who will give some brief remarks and an announcement. And then Ambassador Sam Brownback, who is our global ambassador for religious freedom, will then unveil the report and take some of your questions. And I’ll moderate, since we all know one another, so I’ll call on you. And then we’ll have to wrap it up.


	Thank you so much. Secretary Pompeo, go right ahead, sir.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Thank you. Thanks, Heather.


	Good morning, everyone. It is my great privilege to join you this morning and to release the 2017 International Religious Freedom Report. This report is a testament to the United States’ historic role in preserving and advocating for religious freedom around the world.


	Religious freedom is in the American bloodstream. It’s what brought the pilgrims here from England. Our founders understood it as our first freedom. That is why they articulated it so clearly in the First Amendment. As James Madison wrote years before he was president or secretary of state, quote, “conscience is the most sacred of all property,” end of quote.


	Religious freedom was vital to America’s beginning. Defending it is critical to our future.


	Religious freedom is not only ours. It is a right belonging to every individual on the globe. President Trump stands with those who yearn for religious liberty. Our Vice President stands with them, and so do I.


	Advancing liberty and religious freedom advances America’s interests. Where fundamental freedoms of religion, expression, press, and peaceful assembly are under attack, we find conflict, instability, and terrorism. On the other hand, governments and societies that champion these freedoms are more secure, stable, and peaceful.


	So for all of these reasons, protecting and promoting global respect for religious freedom is a priority of the Trump administration. As our National Security Strategy so clearly states: “Our Founders understood religious freedom not as the state’s creation, but as the gift of God to every person and a fundamental right for a flourishing society.” We’re committed to promoting religious freedom around the world, both now and in the future.


	And Ambassador Brownback and I will talk about that today. We have underscored that commitment with his appointment. It’s great to have a friend and a fellow Kansan up here with me today. International religious freedom deserves to be a front-burner issue, and Ambassador Brownback and I, with him leading the way, will ensure that it continues to be so.


	The ambassador and our team in our Office of International Religious Freedom have been working tirelessly throughout the federal government and with our colleagues here at the department and in embassies overseas with NGOs, foreign partners to defend religious freedom in the farthest corners of the globe.


	This report demonstrates the hard work of American diplomats to protect American and universal values. I’m proud of my team in completing this report. The release of the 2017 International Religious Freedom Report is critical to our mission to defend religious liberty. It brings to light the state of religious freedom all over the world. It documents, across 200 countries and territories, reports of violations and abuses committed by governments, terrorist groups, and individuals so that we may work together to solve them.


	I have a number of examples here. For the sake of time, I’m going to pass through them. But know that we are working in countries around the world to ensure that religious freedom remains the case, and where it is not, that it becomes so.


	Governor – or excuse me, Ambassador Brownback will provide to you more details. But we are very ignited[1] to announce that later this year we will celebrate the 20th anniversary of the International Religious Freedom Act, a law that reinforces America’s commitment to religious freedom and to helping the persecuted. It is also the 70th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights by the UN, which proclaimed the importance of human rights, including the right for religious freedom.


	The world has made important strides, but we still have a lot of work to do. In that regard, I am pleased to announce that the United States will host the first ever Ministerial to Advance Religious Freedom at the Department of State on July 25th and 26th of this year.


	I look forward to hosting my counterparts from likeminded governments, as well as representatives of international organizations, religious communities, and civil society to reaffirm our commitment to religious freedom as a universal human right. This ministerial, we expect, will break new ground. It will not just be a discussion group. It will be about action. We look forward to identifying concrete ways to push back against persecution and ensure greater respect for religious freedom for all.


	The ministerial will also be my first to host as a Secretary of State, and that’s very intentional. Religious freedom is indeed a universal human right that I will fight for, one that our team at the department will continue to fight for, and one that I know President Trump will continue to fight for. The United States will not stand by as spectators. We will get in the ring and stand in solidarity with every individual who seeks to enjoy their most fundamental of human rights.


	Thank you all for your time. Ambassador Brownback, thank you for this putting this together. I look forward to working with you on it.


QUESTION: Sir, what about the religious prisoners in North Korea? Are you going to discuss that? Are you going to meet in New York?


QUESTION: Sir, do you plan to meet with Kim Yong-chol?

 First, you would have seen, in the last 48 hours, that we had two officers declared persona non grata in Venezuela. We have responded reciprocally by expelling two senior Venezuelan officials from the United States. We are deeply worried about what’s taking place as a result of the sham election that occurred on Sunday the 20th, or we’re – we’re doing all the right things. We have an American there that we desperately want to get back, Joshua Holt, and so know that we are engaged. We were disappointed that the Maduro regime kicked our folks out, although frankly not surprised. We’ve been trying to do the good work that diplomacy brings to a country like – that is occupied by the great people of Venezuela, and Maduro found that unacceptable.


	Second, also in the last 48 hours there, we notified our workforce in China about a medical incident that took place there, in Guangzhou. We had an officer who suffered a medical incident that is consistent with what we had happen to American officers that were serving in Havana. We informed the Chinese government about that. They took – they said all the right things, and are – have demonstrated their willingness to help us identify the vector which led to this medical incident. We have medical teams heading there. We have all the appropriate folks heading to help all of the officers, American officers, serving there in China and doing the things we can to mitigate the risk that we have another incident like this there or, frankly, for that matter, anyplace else in the world.


	And then thirdly, my first three and a half weeks we have taken steps to allow our team to go effectively conduct their jobs, to – to actual announcements. We allowed the team to hire family members, a very ready source of very capable officers to serve alongside our – my current colleagues. We think that will help our families a great deal. And then the hiring freeze itself was lifted.


	Senator Menendez, you said some of the bureaus aren’t hiring. We still have a little bit of guidance that needs to be issued, but most of that is now out. We have end-strength goals. We have a plan for how we’ll do that in a thoughtful way so that resources are expanded appropriately. But know that it is now the case that where our demand signals we need additional talent, the State Department employees are empowered to bring those additional team members on board.


	The third piece is I have spent a fair amount of my time personally and have big teams working to get America’s senior officials on board. There are still big gaps at the assistant secretary level, at the under secretary level. We are – where there were nominees, we’re pushing to make sure they move quickly. And where there weren’t, we’re working to develop nominees to come across so that we can in fact engage all over the world, sharing American ideals and values in the way that the State Department has done historically well. And I look forward to being the leader of the organization that’s back on the playing field leading America’s diplomacy abroad.


	With that, Mr. Chairman, I’ll yield back.

"May 24, 2018","
QUESTION: Secretary Pompeo, thank you very much for doing this interview with us.


SECRETARY POMPEO: It’s wonderful to be with you.


QUESTION: As Secretary of State, you chose Iran as your first major foreign policy speech. Why Iran? Is it because of the urgency or the importance of it?


SECRETARY POMPEO: I think it’s both. It’s something that the President has viewed as a serious threat to Middle East stability and therefore to American national security and also looks at the place that the Iranian people find themselves, and he thinks it’s a place America can help make a difference. He has long thought that the agreement that the previous administration entered into didn’t serve any of those interests – the interests of the Iranian people or Middle East stability or, frankly, for America. And so it was a priority for him and thus I wanted in the first weeks since the Secretary of State to have an opportunity to lay out how President Trump thinks we can make things better in each of those three situations.


QUESTION: What is the ultimate goal of the proposed new security framework, and how is it differ – how does it differ from the initial JCPOA?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Yeah, so very different. Different in breadth and I think different in its goal. The first agreement was very narrow. It was an effort to say that the Iranian regime was spending a ton of money on its nuclear program and it wanted to halt that – a noble objective, a good goal, a worthy one. But the threat that Iran presents is so much greater than that, right. They’re taking – they’re launching missiles into Muslim countries. They’re taking the human rights away from their people.


	All of these things I think President Trump cares deeply about, and so his vision is that if we begin again to set out what we think are pretty basic ideas, right. So these 12 things that I listed are all pretty straightforward. We’re not asking a lot from the Iranian leadership, just behave like normal leaders; don’t loot your people, don’t waste your people’s money on these adventures in Syria and Yemen and in Lebanon and in Iraq, the list goes on; lead your people, build a great nation, use the resources you have for that. That’s all we’re simply looking for.


QUESTION: Is that going to be part of the new proposed security framework that Iran would stop or should stop meddling in other countries’ affairs?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Yeah, so we’ve asked for that. Look, we’ve asked them to stop spreading terror around the world, not to build out militias in Iraq, not to put Iranian dollars and Iranian citizens, who are losing their lives in Syria – it’s inappropriate for Middle East security and it’s bad for the country. So our aim is to set conditions where Iran will behave like a normal nation, right. And if they do that, if they – and this is not the Iranian people. This is the Iranian leaders who have taken control and done this damage. If we can create conditions where they’ll stop that, the Iranian people will have great success, and we will have Americans visiting there, and we’ll have all the great things that we do when there are friends and allies as opposed to folks who are presenting risk to our country.


QUESTION: I’m going to get to the human rights issue also, sir. But if I may, I want to continue on the security framework if possible. How about a requirement for Iran to let inspections in the military sites? Is that going to be part of also the framework?


SECRETARY POMPEO: So it is. With respect to the use of nuclear material in Iran, just as we have in Saudi Arabia, just as we did with the United Arab Emirates, we don’t believe it’s appropriate for Iran to have the capacity to create fissile material, to enrich uranium or have a plutonium facility. If they want a peaceful nuclear energy program, fine, but they could import that material. And other countries do it; it works for many countries around the world. And in order for us to achieve that, to get comfortable that that’s the case, there will have to be inspections. That would include inspections at military sites and research laboratories and all the places that had been participants in previous iterations of Iran’s program.


QUESTION: And you mentioned human rights. There are protests, anti-government protests, all around Iran. I wanted to get your take on that. What do you – how do you feel about these protests? And do you think that United States can maybe support the protestors?


SECRETARY POMPEO: We can certainly provide moral support. I think importantly, the Iranian people will make these decisions for themselves. These protests have been ongoing now for months and months – some of them very small, some of them larger – often very much in sync with what I laid out this past week, their – how this wealth gets distributed to Qasem Soleimani and not the ordinary citizen in southeast Iran or in Tehran or wherever it might be. This wealth is being squandered so that ordinary Iranian citizens are both sending their young men off to fight and die and living lives that aren’t as secure and as wealthy as they could be if Iran would simply change its behavior.


	So it’s not about – you asked about regime change. It’s not about changing the regime. It’s about changing the behavior of the leadership in Iran to comport with what the Iranian people really want them to do.


QUESTION: So it is what earlier John Bolton had said, that the goal of the administration is not regime change in Iran?


SECRETARY POMPEO: That’s correct. Yes, ma’am.


QUESTION: And how do you feel about the opposition groups in the United States and in Europe? Do you support their efforts?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Yes. They should be – so long as they’re working towards the same goal that we are. I’ve seen from time to time that wasn’t always the case with some of the groups, some of the smaller groups, frankly. So long as they’re working towards the same thing. We don’t want them advocating for regime change either. We want them working on behalf of the Iranian people, ordinary Iranian citizens who want nothing more than to live their lives, to be able to take their hijab off, to be able to go to work and raise their families and worship in the way they want to worship. This is for the Iranian people to do, and so if there are those on the outside who are working towards that goal, we certainly welcome it.


QUESTION: Mr. Secretary, two years ago as a congressman you personally wanted to go to Iran, you were prepared to go to Iran, and you wanted to press the leadership – Khamenei and Zarif – to give you access to the American hostages. As Secretary, are you going to press the Iranian leadership again to free the American hostages? And as you know, Bob Levinson has disappeared more than 11 years ago.


SECRETARY POMPEO: I know the story of Mr. Levinson well. I pray for his safe return, and our team works for it every day. As for the other Americans, we hope that the Iranian leadership – Mr. Rouhani and Mr. Zarif, Ayatollah – all would see that it’s in their best interests to – and for nothing more than basic humanity, to allow these innocent Americans to return to their families. There are big, big issues out there, but it seems pretty basic to me that one ought not hold innocent people from returning to their loved ones.


	So yes, we’ll work on it. We’ll pray for it. And we hope that one day, in the same way that we were blessed to have three Americans return from North Korea a few weeks past, we have that same kind of day for those that are being held by the Islamic Republic of Iran.


QUESTION: I wanted to ask you about the chants, the slogans that we still hear inside Iran: “Death to America,” and “Death to Israel.” Before any type of agreement that Iran or Tehran and the United States would have about Iran, don’t you think that it should be a requirement for Iran to stop that?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Yeah, their leaders most especially. In America, people say all kinds of things. We have a wide-open democracy. There are people who like President Trump and who don’t. I find that just fine. I am untroubled by that.


	When you have senior leaders, when you have others fomenting these sort of fake gatherings to do nothing but come after and talk – chant, “Death to America” or “Death to Israel,” the Iranian leadership ought to stop. They ought to stop that because it’s not the right thing for their people.


	I think most Iranians – I think most Iranians look at what we’ve been able to accomplish here in America and how blessed we’ve been, and think that that’s a model that works in the sense of we’ll certainly adopt a different form of democracy, and we’ll have a different form of government, and we’ll have different values and beliefs across a certain set of things, we’ll have different religions, and that – that’s all fine. But the basic common understanding of humanity, that you treat every human being with dignity and respect, that you don’t export violence around the world, that you don’t steal and plunder from your people, those core values that are civilizational, they’re historical – I think the Iranian people share those in the same way that the American people do.


QUESTION: Mr. Secretary, I want to go back to something that you said, part of your speech. You stressed that – stressed, and you just mentioned it, that “no more wealth creation for Iranian kleptocrats.” What is your take on congressional efforts to expose the hidden wealth of the corrupt leaders of Iran, from Ayatollah Khamenei to the president? And if there is such a bill that would pass Congress, would the administration support this exposure?


SECRETARY POMPEO: We would. We think it’s very important. It’s just as important as an informational matter. The Iranian people deserve the truth. You have senior leaders that are pocketing money, using businesses that are nominally fronts, and frankly, just stealing. To the extent we can prove that and demonstrate that, I’d welcome the chance to expose it so the Iranian people can judge for themselves whether these are the individuals they want to lead their country.


QUESTION: Mr. Secretary, thank you very much.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Thank you very much, ma’am. It was great to be with you.


QUESTION: We appreciate it very, very much.

SECRETARY POMPEO: Good afternoon. I’m pleased today to host State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi here in Washington for my first meeting with[1] the Secretary of State. Thank you. It’s wonderful to see you.


	As you know, the President and this administration is committed to a constructive, results-oriented relationship with China, and I am glad to hear from State Councilor Wang that Beijing shares those goals. We had a great meeting.


	We talked about preparations for the President’s June 12th meeting with Kim Jong-un. I had a chance to hear China’s perspective and appreciated their observations on the opportunity that is before the United States, the DPRK, and the world.


	We discussed our firm commitment to maintain pressure on North Korea and to continue fully enforcing all relevant UN Security Council resolutions related to North Korea until we see and achieve the complete, verifiable, and irreversible denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. We confirm today that we continue to expect all countries, including China, will meet their obligations and fully implement those measures.


	China, the United States, the South Koreans, Japan – we are all fully committed to a bright future for the DPRK if Pyongyang is willing to denuclearize. Until that time arrives, the pressure will continue. I emphasized the President’s firm determination to secure a balanced and fair trade and investment relationship. We know that the discussions are ongoing. Our trade teams will continue their regular engagements on these very important matters to each of our two countries.


	I also raised our concerns about the militarization of the South China Sea. We had a good discussion. We have other important priorities in our relationship with China as well, such as stopping the flow of opioids coming from China into the United States, protecting American intellectual property, and upholding human rights and religious freedom.


	We had a wonderful discussion, where we hope that our two countries can build an excellent relationship, the same way that our two leaders have done, so that we can achieve great things for our two countries together. I look forward to traveling to visit with you in Beijing in the not-too-distant future and to continue the discussions that we had today.


	Councilor Wang will now share some remarks, and then I’m happy to take a question at the conclusion of his remarks.


	Welcome.


STATE COUNCILOR WANG: (Via interpreter) I am here for a stopover after I attended the G20 Foreign Ministers meeting in Argentina together with Secretary of the State. This is our first meeting. I hope to establish good working relationship with him. Because this is a stopover so there was not a plan for a joint press conference, Mr. Secretary of State was keen for us to meet with the press together, and I said we defer, as the guest, to our host.


	Just now we had a very candid and in-depth discussion. We first discussed the bilateral relationship between China and the United States. We both believe that China-U.S. relationship is the most important bilateral relationship to each other. We both believe that our cooperation far outweighs differences, and opportunities we face far outweighs challenges.


	We commend the strategic guidance that our two presidents provide to China-U.S. relationship, and we are ready to work to implement the series of consensuses reached by the two presidents, including respecting each other’s major interests and properly handling Taiwan and other sensitive issues. And we need to stay clear of disruptions and overcome difficulties and work together to ensure that China-U.S. relationship will continue to enjoy sound and healthy development.


	We both believe that the two teams have conducted intensive discussions recently on trade. These discussions are constructive and have produced positive and important progress. We believe it is important that both sides are willing to do addition instead of reduction to ease as early as possible and finally address the trade imbalance. We hope that these common understanding could be implemented at an early date through further and detailed consultations. We both hope to strengthen cooperation on international and regional issues and facilitate the political solution to hot-spot issues. In general, we hope that with us working together the cooperation list between our two sides could be longer, and the list of differences will get shorter and shorter.


	On the Korean nuclear issue that is at the center of attention, we also exchanged views. I listened to the analysis of Mr. Secretary on the recent development of the situation and his perspectives. I want to tell you that, first of all, China is firmly committed to denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. This position will not change. At the same time, we believe that in achieving the process or the goal of denuclearization, it is necessary to address the legitimate security concerns of the DPRK at an appropriate time, and along with the realization of denuclearization, it is important to establish a long-term and effective peace mechanism on the Korean Peninsula.


	And second, China firmly supports the meeting between the United States and the DPRK leaders. Direct and – contact and dialogue between the leaders is key to addressing the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula. We look forward to seeing the meeting take place as scheduled and be successful. We believe that President Trump and Chairman Kim Jong-un are fully able and they have the wisdom to make the right decision and bring peace to the Korean Peninsula and bring good news to the world.


	And thirdly, China firmly honors its due international obligation. We will continue to fully and strictly implement UN Security Council resolutions on the DPRK and continue to work to maintain peace and stability of the Korean Peninsula. Thank you.


MS NAUERT: Thank you, sir. We have time for one question for each leader. First, we’ll go to Andrea Mitchell from NBC News, and then my counterpart will take over and call upon some of her colleagues for a question (inaudible).


QUESTION: Thank you very much, Under Secretary Nauert, Mr. Secretary, Councilor Wang. Mr. Secretary, first, do you anticipate that, contrary to some suggestions from the DPRK and certainly the President’s cautions yesterday, that there is a substantial chance that the summit will not take place? Do you believe that it will take place on November 12th, that the obstacles can be overcome?


SECRETARY POMPEO: On June – on June 12th.


QUESTION: Secondly, I wanted to ask you about the decision by the United States today to disinvite China from participating in the military exercises in the South China Seas. You discussed the militarization of the South China Seas, and I wanted to know from your talks whether you have been satisfied with China’s response. And Minister Wang, how concerned are you by this disinvitation to participate, and whether you too are satisfied that the meeting on November 12th will take place.


	And finally, if you’ll forgive one more question. Mr. Secretary, you raised the issue of what happened to an American diplomat with mild brain trauma in Guangzhou, and it sounds very similar to what was experienced by our diplomats in Cuba. Are you satisfied with the security and safety of our diplomats in China? And if not, would you take retaliatory steps as the United States did against Havana and withdraw diplomats and also demand that diplomats leave the United States?


	And finally, if I could ask for your indulgence, Minister Wang.


MS NAUERT: (Off-mike.)


SECRETARY POMPEO: That’s three, as I recall. Yes.


QUESTION: If you could explain what happened and whether you are taking steps to investigate the safety of our diplomats and perhaps other diplomats under your guardianship in your country. Thank you so very much.


SECRETARY POMPEO: So let me try to answer them in the reverse sequence that you asked them. First, with respect to the health incident that occurred, we’re concerned about it. It’s a serious medical incident. We want to make sure and take care of every one of our officers serving overseas.


	We’ve learned about it only recently. We are still trying to identify all the circumstances surrounding it. We have notified China of what took place as best we know it, and they have responded in a way that is exactly the right response. They’ve honored their commitment under the Vienna Convention to take care of the diplomats that are serving in their country, and we truly appreciate this. They’ve offered to assist us in investigating how this came to be and are – and State Councilor Wang and I had a moment to talk about how we can endeavor to figure out what happened here to ensure that something like this doesn’t happen again in their country. And so we’re working together to resolve it. I look forward to – I hope we can figure it out. It’s very important that each and every one of our officers, wherever they’re serving in the world, is protected and taken care of.


	Second, you asked about June 12th. We’re still working, driving towards the date. I hope that it takes place. Chairman Kim requested a meeting. We – President Trump agreed. We worked to find a date and a location, we had it settled, and I’m hopeful. What I can say for sure is our team is preparing up and down the administration. The President will absolutely be prepared for the meeting as well, and I hope that we can have this opportunity, this historic opportunity to do something that would truly transform this global challenge that’s been threatening the world for an awfully long time.


	Can you remind me, Andrea, your second question? Ah, it was about RIMPAC and the disinvitation of RIMPAC.


QUESTION: The disinvitation --


SECRETARY POMPEO: Yes.


QUESTION: The disinvitation for the military exercises.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Yes. State Councilor Wang and I spoke about it. I will leave to DOD to talk about that. Only to say that we have expressed consistent concern about militarization of the South China Sea. We had a chance to talk about that. And I will leave to our militaries to talk about their efforts together.


QUESTION: Thank you.


QUESTION: (Via interpreter) I’m from CCTV. Recently the U.S. has taken some negative moves on Taiwan, and that has caused high tension and dissatisfaction on the part of the Chinese people. My question to Mr. Secretary is that: Is there any change in the U.S. on the “one China” principle? And also views from State Councilor Wang. Thank you.


SECRETARY POMPEO: No change. It’s the same policy that America’s had consistently. There has not been any change there. State Councilor Wang?


STATE COUNCILOR WANG: (Via interpreter) This is a question on Taiwan and whether the U.S. has changed its policy. That indeed is a reflection of the concerns of the Chinese people. Mr. Secretary has said that there’s no change to the U.S. policy, and we don’t want to see a change. There should not be a change. This touches upon the political foundation of China-U.S. relations. We would urge the U.S. to honor the “one China” principle and the stipulations in the three Joint Communiques and prudently and properly manage Taiwan-related issues to uphold the overall interests of China-U.S. relations and peace and stability across the straits.


	Just now the U.S. reporter asked about a U.S. diplomat in China. Our understanding, this is an individual case of an American diplomat in Guangzhou. China has been investigating this matter in a very responsible manner and we haven’t found that any organization or individual has carried out such a sonic influence. We will stay in communication with the U.S. through diplomatic channels, and we would suggest that U.S. side can also carry out some internal investigation.


	We don’t want to see that this individual case will be magnified, complicated, or even politicized. We hope people will not associate it with other unnecessary matters. China will, in accordance with the law, protect all the lawful rights and interests of foreigners in China, especially those of diplomats. That’s our firm commitment.


	On the Pentagon’s decision or disinvitation of Chinese military in the RIMPAC exercise, we find that a very unconstructive move, nonconstructive move. It’s also a decision that’s taken lightly. It’s unhelpful to mutual understanding between China and the U.S. We hope the U.S. will change such a negative mindset. Both China, the U.S. are big countries, and we are well positioned to have greater cooperation at sea. Mil-to-mil exchanges will help to increase mutual trust. It will also help us to make greater efforts towards world peace and stability.


	On the so-called militarization in the South China Sea, we talked about this issue just now. China is only building civilian and some necessary defense facilities on our own islands. That is the right to self-defense and preservation of every sovereign state. It is a normal deployment and has nothing to do with militarization, just like the U.S. has military presence in Hawaii, in Guam. And China’s deployment is at a much smaller scale than the U.S. It’s just out of necessary defense purposes. We don’t hope to see any exaggeration or hype-up of this matter.


	Whether the summit between U.S. and DPRK will go ahead as scheduled, I made it very clear that we hope it will go ahead as scheduled and we hope it will be productive, it will deliver outcomes. There is already good basis and necessary conditions at the moment. And I told our U.S. colleagues that if you want to solve the problem, now is the time. If you want peace, now is the time. If you want to make history, now is the time. Thank you.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Thank you.

SECRETARY POMPEO: Thank you. Thank you, Chairman Royce, thank you Ranking Member Engel. It’s good to see you both again. And thank you distinguished members of the committee that I had the privilege to serve with. It is great to be back.


	And I appreciate the opportunity to discuss the 2019 budget request for the State Department --


CHAIRMAN ROYCE: And Mr. Secretary, maybe if we straighten the microphone it’ll be --


SECRETARY POMPEO: Yes. How’s that? Is that good enough?


CHAIRMAN ROYCE: Perfect.


SECRETARY POMPEO: All right. Very good.


	And thanks. I want to talk about both State Department and USAID’s budgets this morning.


	In order to achieve the objectives laid out in the national security strategy, we have a plan. And you’ll hear a great deal about it today. The proposed request reflects our obligation to use taxpayer dollars wisely and effectively.


	Our request also makes clear the United States must exert a proportional financial commitment in the pursuit of goals shared by the entire international community. It is time for other nations – especially those with high GDPs – to assume greater responsibilities and devote greater resources towards our common objectives, whether it’s crushing terrorists, stopping Iran’s malign behavior, strengthening the NATO alliance, eradicating infectious diseases, and so much more. We expect good help, good financial support from our partners and allies.


	President Trump is committed to diplomacy as the primary means of achieving the United States foreign policy objectives. So am I. We must maintain America’s historic role as a truly global power, whose first instinct and overwhelming preference is to use diplomacy to solve global challenges. We’re already seeing this in the preparations for our historic meeting with North Korea, still scheduled for June 12th. We have a generational opportunity to resolve a major national security challenge. Our eyes are wide open to the lessons of history, but we’re optimistic that we can achieve an outcome that would be great for the world. Our posture will not change until we see credible steps taken towards the complete, verifiable, and irreversible denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.


	On Monday I unveiled a new direction for the President’s Iran strategy. We will apply unprecedented financial pressure, coordinate with our DOD colleagues on deterrence efforts, support the Iranian people perhaps most importantly, and hold out the prospect for a new deal with Iran – it simply needs to change its behavior. We seek to work with as many partners, friends, allies as possible to achieve the common objective of stopping all of Iran’s nuclear and non-nuclear threats.


	The President’s highest priority is keeping the American people safe. This request for 7.3 billion in security assistance will help protect Americans at home and overseas, and I look forward to talking more about that today. The State Department will continue to lead the international efforts to denuclearize North Korea, and present – and prevent other actors from unlawfully acquiring weapons of mass destruction as their means of delivery, while strengthening the capacity of partner nations to do so as well. Countering proliferation is at the top of President Trump’s national security agenda.


	The budget request also calls for 5.7 billion in support for coalition efforts to continue to defeat ISIS and other transnational terrorist and criminal groups that threaten Americans everywhere. The State Department and USAID will sustain programs that address the conditions on the ground that give rise to those threats. And we will work diligently to attract additional donors to support these very same efforts.


	America’s prosperity and national security depend on a strong and growing American economy. This budget request seeks 2.2 billion to help stimulate American economic growth by expanding markets for U.S. investment, and ensuring that partner countries can fully participate in the global economy.


	America’s message, a noble one, must be shared with the world at all times. Chairman Royce, you mentioned the Global Engagement Center. We will work with the $55-plus million available to cover both its original mission, countering extremism, plus countering state-sponsored disinformation campaigns. We will not tolerate Russian interference in our 2018 elections. Much work has been done; there’s more to do. Rest assured that we will take the appropriate countermeasures in response to the continued Russian efforts.


	Finally, let me also update you on what is happening inside the State Department. Our workforce is the most important asset. Since becoming Secretary of State, now three weeks and a couple days ago, one of my highest priorities has been ensuring the finest diplomatic corps in the world is fully prepared and empowered to do its work in every corner. I am unleashing teams to do what they do best on behalf of the American people.


	Last week I held my first town hall in which I laid out my vision and committed to working as one team with all of our personnel. In three weeks they’ve given me great support; I have taken their counsel, and I have relied on their expertise greatly. There are many challenges that remain.


	Among my first acts was to begin to put the team back on the field. We lifted the hiring freeze on eligible family members; indeed, broadened that to lifting the hiring freeze for the entire Foreign and Civil Service. All Foreign Service and Civil Service hiring will be consistent with funding levels, but the freeze is no longer.


	To help the team get on the field, I also know we’ve got work to do on some of our system’s IT at the front. I know our professionals need that assistance to perform their work efficiently.


	And with that, Mr. Chairman, I’m happy to conclude my statement as it’s been submitted for the record, and happy to take questions from you and the committee.

MS NAUERT: Hi, everybody. How are you today?


QUESTION: Well --


MS NAUERT: I brought in a special guest with me, our 70th Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who is going to give you a quick briefing out of his meetings at the White House today. I know some of you may have questions following on the Secretary’s Iran speech yesterday. He has just a few minutes to take some of your questions, and then I’ll take over from there and handle the rest of the briefing.


	Secretary Pompeo, welcome. This is our press briefing room. Great to have you here.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Thanks, thanks. Good afternoon, everyone. I actually want to start by talking – it’s almost exactly one month since I’ve been here, and I made a handful of commitments at the beginning, not the least of which was that I would put the team back on the field. And we’ve taken significant steps to date in working towards that direction. There still remains a great deal of work to do, but you should know I am committed to that, and we will get there.


	We’ve lifted the hiring freeze. We can now hire the most talented person, including family members, here – both things that weren’t possible when I arrived. We’ve made substantial progress on some of our senior level processes so that we get our ambassadors and senior level persons working here in the building. Nothing to report just yet, but as I committed when I gave testimony at my confirmation hearing, we’re going to flood the zone. We’re going to work on this diligently. It’s one of my highest priorities to make sure that we’ve got the right people in the right places every place in the world, and here in main State as well, so we can accomplish our diplomatic mission. I hope in the coming week or two to have several significant announcements about who some of the new senior leaders will be.


	Second, I left the White House. I was in the bilateral meetings with the South Koreans. They were constructive. I think Sanders has already given a press conference about this, so I’m happy just to take questions about it. But suffice it to say we are continuing to prepare both our team and the White House so that in the event that the summit takes place on June 12th we are fully prepared, with the mission statement having not changed at all. We are committed to achieving denuclearization and creating conditions such that the North Korean regime no longer threatens the world.


	A final thought. I gave some remarks yesterday on the President’s strategy with respect to the Islamic Republic of Iran, and I think it’s important that I re-emphasize that the tasks that Iran needs to undertake aren’t that difficult. I’ve seen reports that these are a fantasy and they can’t happen, but we ask for things that are really fairly simple that, frankly, most nations in the world engage in. We ask them to stop firing missiles into Riyadh. This is not – it’s not a fantasy to imagine the Iranians making a decision not to fire missiles into another nation and threatening American lives that travel through that airport. It’s not a fantasy to ask them to cease engaging in terror. These were all a set of demands, the demands we put on the rest of the world.


	If it was the case that some other country in the Middle East desired to build a nuclear weapons system, we would work to stop them too. These are a set of simple requirements that the Iranian regime could quite easily comply with, and it would benefit the Iranian people to an enormous extent. And so, frankly, what we laid out seemed like a pretty straightforward set of requirements that we would put on any country in the world – to stop malign behavior that threatens other of its neighbors and other parts of the world.


	And with that, Heather, I’m happy to take a couple questions.


MS NAUERT: Okay. Just a few minutes for questions. Matt Lee. You met Matt on our last trip. So Matt.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Yes. Matt, good to see you --


QUESTION: Good to see you, sir.


SECRETARY POMPEO: -- in Washington. (Laughter.) Had to think about where I was for a second.


QUESTION: Well, certainly not Pyongyang, that’s for sure. Just on North Korea and the meetings today, we don’t met – we have just met, so I don’t know if you’re a betting man. But if you were a betting man, what would you say the odds are for this meeting actually coming off and at the date and venue that’s been set? And if it – are you prepared to go back or to meet again, wherever, with Kim Jong-un, if that is decided – if that’s necessary to actually fully prepare for a summit?


SECRETARY POMPEO: I’ll take your second question first. The second one is we will do what it takes to make sure that this is a successful meeting, whether that’s meeting with the North Koreans in some third country or whatever it may take. We are prepared. The President will ask us to ensure that we’ve done all we can to make sure that we have the real opportunity to have this historic successful outcome.


	And I’m not a betting man – (laughter) – so I wouldn’t care to predict whether it will happen, only to predict that we’ll be ready in the event that it does.


MS NAUERT: Nick from Bloomberg.


QUESTION: Mr. Secretary --


SECRETARY POMPEO: Yes, sir.


QUESTION: -- thanks very much. There were reports that when you met with Kim Jong-un you were looking out at a sunset, and he allegedly said, “Wouldn’t it be great if there were American hotels lining this scene?” Do you believe that he’s open to the idea of American investment in North Korea? And can you also give us your thoughts on what would explain the change in tone from North Korea? The President said he thought China had something to do with this.


SECRETARY POMPEO: You mean the tone this past week, as opposed to --


QUESTION: In the last week, correct.


SECRETARY POMPEO: -- the trajectory. No, I’m not going to talk about that, speculate about that. We’re preparing. We’re continuing to do our work and lay the foundation for a successful meeting. I’m confident we’ll get there.


	With respect to Chairman Kim, I haven’t spoken publicly about the conversations we’ve had. They were between he and I. But I do have a real sense that he would find American investment, American technology, American know-how of real value to his people, and it’s something that he and I had a chance to speak about generally. And I do think it’s something that, if we get this right and we get the denuclearization right, that America would be quite capable of delivering them with lots of things that would make life better for the North Korean people.


MS NAUERT: Rich Edson from Fox News.


QUESTION: Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Secretary.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Hi, Rich.


QUESTION: The South Korean Government today put the chances at – we’re not talking specific numbers here, but they did put it at 99 percent.


SECRETARY POMPEO: I heard that. I heard they said 99.


QUESTION: Is there something that gave President Trump pause in direct conversations that this government has had with the North Koreans? And how would you describe, since you’ve left Pyongyang, what kind of communication the United States has had with the Government of North Korea?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Yeah, I won’t characterize that. I don’t think there’s anything that’s given us pause. Chairman Kim asked for this meeting. President Trump agreed to undertake it. We worked to find a date and location. We got those set. And since then, we’re driving on.


	It is clear we are working to make sure that there’s a common understanding about the contents of what will be discussed, but I’m optimistic. But again, it could – this could be something that comes right to the end and it doesn’t happen. As the President said, we’ll see. And I think that’s the place that we find ourselves.


MS NAUERT: Francesco from AFP.


QUESTION: Yes. So the President said --


SECRETARY POMPEO: Yes, sir.


QUESTION: Thank you for doing this. The President said that the summit might be delayed. Are you discussing now the – a possible new date or it being delayed with the North Koreans? And what are the issues that would prevent it to be on June 12th? Are – they’re logistical or on the things that you want to discuss with them?


SECRETARY POMPEO: We’re still working towards June 12th.


QUESTION: But you’re discussing this with them?


SECRETARY POMPEO: We’re working towards June 12th.


MS NAUERT: Conor Finnegan from ABC.


QUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Secretary. If I could turn to Iran, in your speech yesterday, you talked about this unprecedented financial pressure that you want to bear on Iran. I think your critics, when they bring up the idea of a fantasy, they say that it’s because the Europeans won’t go along with you on these sanctions, and that therefore you can’t recreate this tremendous financial pressure. How do you – what do you say to those critics? How do you get the Europeans to go along, and then others like China or Russia, who continue to abide by the agreement?


SECRETARY POMPEO: It’s really straightforward. This is a global challenge. This is a global challenge. I mentioned in my remarks yesterday, right, Qods Force assassinations in European countries. This is a shared threat across the world. And I am confident that we can collectively develop a diplomatic response that achieves the simple outcomes that we put forward. We wouldn’t tolerate Iceland doing what the Iranians are doing.


QUESTION: Why --


SECRETARY POMPEO: We wouldn’t tolerate Chad doing what the – I mean, I could just pick a number. I’m sort of tripping through the alphabet, right? We wouldn’t tolerate another nation behaving with terrorist activity by putting proxy forces that threaten Americans in Iraq. Just the list is long. We wouldn’t tolerate that, right?


	If somebody else created an equivalent of Hizballah, would we sit by? We wouldn’t. Neither would the Europeans. Neither will the other Arab countries. Russia and China don’t see that as a positive impact around the world either. So I am confident that there is a shed of – set of overlapping values and interests here that will drive us to the same conclusion about the need to respond to the Islamic Republic of Iran’s threats to the world.


QUESTION: I’m sure you saw some of the responses --


MS NAUERT: Conor, we have to move along.


QUESTION: Sure.


MS NAUERT: Kylie, go ahead, from CBS News.


QUESTION: If we could just go back to the President’s comments today discussing China. And he was – he caused some alarm when he spoke about Xi’s second meeting with Kim Jong-un. Do you know any more about that meeting and why he is so hesitant to say that the Chinese were helpful in that meeting?


SECRETARY POMPEO: I don’t have anything to add to what the President said there.


QUESTION: Okay. Are the Chinese helping push forward the U.S.-Kim Jong-un summit? Can you talk about their role?


SECRETARY POMPEO: The Chinese have offered historic assistance in the pressure campaign – literally historic assistance. President Trump has made clear and I’ve made clear too that it’s incredibly central that that pressure remain in place and that China continue to participate in that pressure campaign. And we have every reason to expect that they will continue to do so.


MS NAUERT: Carol Morello from The Washington Post.


QUESTION: Hello.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Hi.


MS NAUERT: And you’ve met Carol before.


QUESTION: (Inaudible.) Say, President Rouhani said yesterday that he questioned, who are you to tell another nation what to do in its foreign policy. So who are you to tell them what to do? What response do you have to him?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Yeah, I didn’t see those remarks. The Iranian people get to choose. The Iranian people get to choose for themselves the kind of leadership they want, the kind of government that they want. They get to choose the individuals who lead their country and then they get to live with the choices that those leaders make. I wasn’t describing what Mr. Rouhani should do or what Mr. Zarif should do. I was only articulating what America intends to do.


MS NAUERT: And last question, Nike Ching from VOA.


QUESTION: Thank you very much, Mr. Secretary. So my question is on the Iranian hostage. Yesterday you mentioned that the government is working very hard to bring the American hostage home. Could you please give us a update and elaborate what efforts are underway, given the frosty relations between the two? Thanks.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Yes. I suppose one might have two months ago described the relationship of the United States and the DPRK as frosty, and we returned three Americans. We almost always have our citizens detained by countries that aren’t friendly to us. We work to find mechanisms that deliver these important outcomes. I have talked to many family members, and I know how central that is. You can rest assured that not only is the State Department but the entire United States Government working diligently to bring each – I mentioned a handful of names yesterday; there are more around the world I didn’t identify in yesterday’s remarks. You should know we are working diligently along every avenue that we can develop to get these folks to return back home, back to their families.


	Yeah, I’ll take one more, Heather. Yeah.


MS NAUERT: Okay. Michelle Kosinski from CNN.


QUESTION: Okay, thanks. I’m trying to make this worth our time. On Iran --


SECRETARY POMPEO: That’d be useful. That’d be good, yeah.


QUESTION: (Laughter.) Since it’s our last question. The demands, or whatever you want to call them, that you laid out for Iran yesterday – it seems like there – partially because you’ve laid them all out and partially because of what they are, there’s not going to be much room for negotiation, if any, on any of those. Would you agree with that? And because of the way that was put out there, what makes you think that Iran is going to be willing to work with the U.S. on this? If it’s sanctions, wouldn’t that take a very long time at this point?


SECRETARY POMPEO: I don’t know which of those demands – should we allow them to be terrorists? Is that one we should compromise on?


QUESTION: But that’s what I’m saying. There is no room for compromise --


SECRETARY POMPEO: Should we – how many missiles are they allowed to fire? I mean, I’m --


QUESTION: Right. So where is the room for negotiation?


SECRETARY POMPEO: The answer is we – the benchmark – the benchmark I set forward yesterday is a very low standard. It’s the standard behavior we expect from countries all around the world. There is – there aren’t a special set of rules that we set forward yesterday for Iran. We simply asked them to behave the way normal, non-belligerent nations behave. That’s it. It’s simple. We didn’t – there’s not a special category of people who are permitted to fire missiles into Riyadh. We just asked them to behave like a normal nation.


	And so I have every reason to think that the Iranian people want that for their country as well. This is a rich country with a deep civilization and a wonderful history, and I’m convinced – I’m convinced that the people of Iran, when they can see a path forward which will lead their country to stop behaving in this way, will choose that path.


	Thank you all. I look forward to seeing you down here.


QUESTION: Thank you.


QUESTION: Yes.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Everybody have a good day.


QUESTION: See you again soon.


SECRETARY POMPEO: I can’t promise soon, but see you again. (Laughter.)


QUESTION: (Off-mike.)


MS NAUERT: Thanks, sir.

MS JAMES: Good morning. (Applause.) Welcome to the Heritage Foundation. My name is Kay James and I have the honor of being the president here. It is a pleasure and honor to welcome our distinguished guest, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, back to Heritage. Yes, I said back. Some of you may remember that then-Congressman Pompeo spoke here on September 9th, 2015. His presence was appreciated, as his topic was timely. It was entitled “A Pathway Forward: An Alternative to the Flawed Iran Nuclear Deal.” And now we have the great pleasure of being with our friend in his new role as Secretary of State for the United States of America. It’s not just a pleasure having him here; it’s truly an honor that he chose Heritage as the site for his first public address as Secretary.


	Our scholars here are dedicated to advancing individual freedom and national security, and his presence here is a wonderful affirmation of the positive impact that their work is having. And so to Secretary Pompeo, I’d like to say thank you.


	Now, I imagine all who are in this room and watching online know a great deal about Secretary Pompeo, but please allow me to provide just a few highlights from his extraordinary career. Secretary Pompeo graduated first in his class at the United States military academy at West Point, and then served as a cavalry officer patrolling the Iron Curtain before the fall of the Berlin Wall. He also served with the 2nd Squadron, 7th Cavalry in the U.S. Army’s 4th Infantry Division. After leaving active duty, he attended and graduated from Harvard Law School where he served as an editor of the Harvard Law Review. He then had a successful private sector career, founding and serving as CEO of Thayer Aerospace and then becoming president of Sentry International.


	Secretary Pompeo’s public service began when he was elected representative of Kansas’s 4th Congressional District, and his distinguished tenure on the Hill included service on the House Intelligence Committee, the Energy and Commerce Committee, and the House Select Benghazi Committee. Recognizing the Secretary’s many talents, President Trump tapped him as director of the CIA, where he served from January 2017 to April 2018. And now, of course, he is our Secretary of State, having been sworn in just three and a half weeks ago.


	Last but, of course, never least, Secretary Pompeo is married to Susan Pompeo and has one son, Nick.


	Secretary Pompeo, on behalf of the board of trustees, the staff, and all of the friends of the Heritage Foundation, welcome back to home. (Applause.)


SECRETARY POMPEO: Well, good morning, everyone. I first want to thank the Heritage Foundation and its president, Kay Coles James. Thank you for hosting me today. First as a private citizen and then as a member of Congress, and even today, the Heritage Foundation has shaped my thinking on matters of the world and public policy issues. I’m grateful for that excellent work.


	And thanks for reminding me I can’t talk about anything else but what we’re talking about today. (Laughter.) Three years on. But it’s an honor to be here.


	Two weeks ago, President Trump terminated the United States participation in the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, more commonly known as the Iran nuclear deal.


	President Trump withdrew from the deal for a simple reason: it failed to guarantee the safety of the American people from the risk created by the leaders of the Islamic Republic of Iran.


	No more. No more wealth creation for Iranian kleptocrats. No more acceptance of missiles landing in Riyadh and in the Golan Heights. No more cost-free expansions of Iranian power. No more.


	The JCPOA put the world at risk because of its fatal flaws.


	And they’re worth recounting at some length today, if only for the purpose of ensuring that subsequent arrangements do not repeat them.


	For example, the weak sunset provisions of the JCPOA merely delayed the inevitable nuclear weapons capability of the Iranian regime.


	After the countdown clock ran out on the deal’s sunset provisions, Iran would be free for a quick sprint to the bomb, setting off a potentially catastrophic arms race in the region. Indeed, the very brevity of the delay in the Iranian nuclear program itself incentivized Middle Eastern proliferation.


	Moreover, as we have seen from Israel’s recent remarkable intelligence operation, Iran has lied for years about having had a nuclear weapons program. Iran entered into the JCPOA in bad faith. It is worth noting that even today, the regime continues to lie.


	Just last month, Iranian Foreign Minister Zarif told a Sunday morning news show, “We never wanted to produce a bomb.”


	This claim – this claim would be laughable if not for the willful deception behind it. Not only did the AMAD Program exist; the Iranians took great care – though, as we can see now, not enough care – to protect, hide, and preserve the work of Mohsen Fakhrizadeh Mahabadi and his gang of nuclear scientists.


	The JCPOA had additional shortcomings as well.


	The mechanisms for inspecting and verifying Iran’s compliance with the deal were simply not strong enough.


	The deal did nothing to address Iran’s continuing development of ballistic and cruise missiles, which could deliver nuclear warheads.


	The JCPOA permitted the Iranian regime to use the money from the JCPOA to boost the economic fortunes of a struggling people, but the regime’s leaders refused to do so.


	Instead, the government spent its newfound treasure fueling proxy wars across the Middle East and lining the pockets of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, Hizballah, Hamas, and the Houthis.


	Remember: Iran advanced its march across the Middle East during the JCPOA. Qasem Soleimani has been playing with house money that has become blood money. Wealth created by the West has fueled his campaigns.


	Strategically, the Obama administration made a bet that the deal would spur Iran to stop its rogue state actions and conform to international norms.


	That bet was a loser with massive repercussions for all of the people living in the Middle East.


	The idea of the JCPOA as a strategic pillar of stability in the Middle East was captured perfectly by John Kerry when he said, quote, “I know the Middle East that is on fire … is going to be more manageable with this deal,” end of quote.


	Query whether the Middle East is more manageable today than it was when they embarked on the JCPOA.


	Lebanon is an even more comfortable home for Hizballah today than it was when we embarked on the JCPOA. Hizballah is now armed to the teeth by Iran and has its sights set on Israel.


	Thanks to Iran, Hizballah provides the ground forces for the military expedition in Syria. The IRGC, too, has continued to pump thousands of fighters into Syria to prop up the murderous Assad regime and help make that country 71,000 square miles of kill zone.


	Iran perpetuates a conflict that has displaced more than 6 million Syrians inside the – 6 million Syrians and caused over 5 million to seek refuge outside of its borders.


	These refugees include foreign fighters who have crossed into Europe and threatened terrorist attacks in those countries.


	In Iraq, Iran sponsored Shia militia groups and terrorists to infiltrate and undermine the Iraqi Security Forces and jeopardize Iraq’s sovereignty – all of this during the JCPOA.


	In Yemen, Iran’s support for the Houthi militia fuels a conflict that continues to starve the Yemeni people and hold them under the threat of terror.


	The IRGC has also given Houthi missiles to attack civilian targets in Saudi Arabia and the Emirates and to threaten international shipping in the Red Sea.


	And in Afghanistan, Iran’s support to the Taliban in the form of weapons and funding leads to further violence and hinders peace and stability for the Afghan people.


	Today, the Iranian Qods Force conducts covert assassination operations in the heart of Europe.


	We should remember, too, that during the JCPOA Iran continues to hold Americans hostage: Baquer Namazi, Siamak Namazi, Xiyue Wang, and Bob Levinson, who has been missing for over 11 years.


	I will note for the American people, you should know we are working diligently to bring each American missing wrongfully detained in Iran home.


	The list continues. Iran continues to be, during the JCPOA, the world’s largest sponsor of terror. It continues to serve as sanctuary for al-Qaida, as it has done since 9/11, and remains unwilling to bring to justice senior al-Qaida members residing in Tehran.


	Today we ask the Iranian people: Is this what you want your country to be known for, for being a co-conspirator with Hizballah, Hamas, the Taliban, and al-Qaida? The United States believe you deserve better.


	And I have an additional point for the Iranian people to ponder. Here in the West, President Rouhani and Foreign Minister Zarif are often held apart from the regime’s unwise terrorist and malign behavior. They are treated somehow differently.


	The West says, “Boy, if only they could control Ayatollah Khamenei and Qasem Soleimani then things would be great.” Yet, Rouhani and Zarif are your elected leaders. Are they not the most responsible for your economic struggles? Are these two not responsible for wasting Iranian lives throughout the Middle East?


	It’s worth the Iranian people considering, because instead of helping their own citizens, the regime continues to seek a corridor stretching from Iran’s borders to the shores of the Mediterranean. Iran wants this corridor to transport fighters and an advanced weapons system to Israel’s doorsteps. Indeed in recent months, the IRGC has flown an armed drone into Israeli airspace and launched salvos of rockets into the Golan Heights from Syria. Our steadfast ally has asserted the sovereign right of self-defense in response, a stance the United States will continue to unequivocally support.


	So the bet – the bet that the JCPOA would increase Middle East stability was a bad one for America, for Europe, for the Middle East, and indeed for the entire world. It is clear that the JCPOA has not ended Iran’s nuclear ambitions, nor did it deter its quest for a regional hegemony. Iran’s leaders saw the deal as the starting gun for the march across the Middle East.


	So, the path forward. America’s commitment to the Iran strategy President Trump laid down in October remains. It will now be executed outside of the JCPOA.


	We’ll continue to work with allies to counter the regime’s destabilizing activities in the region, block their financing of terror, and address Iran’s proliferation of missiles and other advanced weapons systems that threaten peace and stability. We will also ensure Iran has no path to a nuclear weapon – not now, not ever.


	Following our withdrawal from the JCPOA, President Trump has asked me to achieve these goals on Iran. We’ll pursue those goals along several lines of effort.


	First, we will apply unprecedented financial pressure on the Iranian regime. The leaders in Tehran will have no doubt about our seriousness.


	Thanks to our colleagues at the Department of Treasury, sanctions are going back in full effect and new ones are coming. Last week we imposed sanctions on the head of Iran’s central bank and other entities that were funneling money to the IRGC Qods Force. They were also providing money to Hizballah and other terrorist organizations. The Iranian regime should know that this is just the beginning.


	This sting of sanctions will be painful if the regime does not change its course from the unacceptable and unproductive path it has chosen to one that rejoins the league of nations. These will indeed end up being the strongest sanctions in history when we are complete.


	The regime has been fighting all over the Middle East for years. After our sanctions come in force, it will be battling to keep its economy alive.


	Iran will be forced to make a choice: either fight to keep its economy off life support at home or keep squandering precious wealth on fights abroad. It will not have the resources to do both.


	Second, I will work closely with the Department of Defense and our regional allies to deter Iranian aggression.


	We will ensure freedom of navigation on the waters in the region. We will work to prevent and counteract any Iranian malign cyber activity. We will track down Iranian operatives and their Hizballah proxies operating around the world and we will crush them. Iran will never again have carte blanche to dominate the Middle East.


	And I’d remind the leadership in Iran what President Trump said: If they restart their nuclear program, it will mean bigger problems – bigger problems than they’d ever had before.


	Third, we will also advocate tirelessly for the Iranian people. The regime must improve how it treats its citizens. It must protect the human rights of every Iranian. It must cease wasting Iran’s wealth abroad.


	We ask that our international partners continue to add their voice to ours in condemning Iran’s treatment of its own citizens.


	The protests – the protests of the past few months show that the Iranian people are deeply frustrated with their own government’s failures.


	The Iranian economy is struggling as a result of bad Iranian decisions. Workers aren’t getting paid, strikes are a daily occurrence, and the rial is plummeting. Youth unemployment is at a staggering 25 percent.


	Government mismanagement of Iran’s natural resources has led to severe droughts and other environmental crises as well.


	Look, these problems are compounded by enormous corruption inside of Iran, and the Iranian people can smell it. The protests last winter showed that many are angry at the regime that keeps for itself what the regime steals from its people.


	And Iranians too are angry at a regime elite that commits hundreds of millions of dollars to military operations and terrorist groups abroad while the Iranian people cry out for a simple life with jobs and opportunity and with liberty.


	The Iranian regime’s response to the protests has only exposed the country’s leadership is running scared. Thousands have been jailed arbitrarily, and at least dozens have been killed.


	As seen from the hijab protests, the brutal men of the regime seem to be particularly terrified by Iranian women who are demanding their rights. As human beings with inherent dignity and inalienable rights, the women of Iran deserve the same freedoms that the men of Iran possess.


	But this is all on top of a well-documented terror and torture that the regime has inflicted for decades on those who dissent from the regime’s ideology.


	The Iranian regime is going to ultimately have to look itself in the mirror. The Iranian people, especially its youth, are increasingly eager for economic, political, and social change.


	The United States stands with those longing for a country of economic opportunity, government transparency, fairness, and greater liberty.


	We hope, indeed we expect, that the Iranian regime will come to its senses and support – not suppress – the aspirations of its own citizens.


	We’re open to new steps with not only our allies and partners, but with Iran as well. But only if Iran is willing to make major changes.


	As President Trump said two weeks ago, he is ready, willing, and able to negotiate a new deal. But the deal is not the objective. Our goal is to protect the American people.


	Any new agreement will make sure Iran never acquires a nuclear weapon, and will deter the regime’s malign behavior in a way that the JCPOA never could. We will not repeat the mistakes of past administrations, and we will not renegotiate the JCPOA itself. The Iranian wave of destruction in the region in just the last few years is proof that Iran’s nuclear aspirations cannot be separated from the overall security picture.


	So what should it be? We must begin to define what it is that we demand from Iran.


	First, Iran must declare to the IAEA a full account of the prior military dimensions of its nuclear program, and permanently and verifiably abandon such work in perpetuity.


	Second, Iran must stop enrichment and never pursue plutonium reprocessing. This includes closing its heavy water reactor.


	Third, Iran must also provide the IAEA with unqualified access to all sites throughout the entire country.


	Iran must end its proliferation of ballistic missiles and halt further launching or development of nuclear-capable missile systems.


	Iran must release all U.S. citizens, as well as citizens of our partners and allies, each of them detained on spurious charges.


	Iran must end support to Middle East terrorist groups, including Lebanese Hizballah, Hamas, and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad.


	Iran must respect the sovereignty of the Iraqi Government and permit the disarming, demobilization, and reintegration of Shia militias.


	Iran must also end its military support for the Houthi militia and work towards a peaceful political settlement in Yemen.


	Iran must withdraw all forces under Iranian command throughout the entirety of Syria.


	Iran, too, must end support for the Taliban and other terrorists in Afghanistan and the region, and cease harboring senior al-Qaida leaders.


	Iran, too, must end the IRG Qods Force’s support for terrorists and militant partners around the world.


	And too, Iran must end its threatening behavior against its neighbors – many of whom are U.S. allies. This certainly includes its threats to destroy Israel, and its firing of missiles into Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. It also includes threats to international shipping and destructive – and destructive cyberattacks.


	That list is pretty long, but if you take a look at it, these are 12 very basic requirements. The length of the list is simply a scope of the malign behavior of Iran. We didn’t create the list, they did.


	From my conversations with European friends, I know that they broadly share these same views of what the Iranian regime must do to gain acceptance in the international community. I ask that America’s allies join us in calling for the Iranian Government to act more responsibly.


	In exchange for major changes in Iran, the United States is prepared to take actions which will benefit the Iranian people. These areas of action include a number of things.


	First, once this is achieved, we’re prepared to end the principal components of every one of our sanctions against the regime. We’re happy at that point to re-establish full diplomatic and commercial relationships with Iran. And we’re prepared to admit[i] Iran to have advanced technology. If Iran makes this fundamental strategic shift, we, too, are prepared to support the modernization and reintegration of the Iranian economy into the international economic system.


	But relief from our efforts will come only when we see tangible, demonstrated, and sustained shifts in Tehran’s policies. We acknowledge Iran’s right to defend its people. But not its actions which jeopardize world’s citizens.


	Also, in contrast to the previous administration, we want to include Congress as a partner in this process. We want our efforts to have broad support with the American people and endure beyond the Trump Administration. A treaty would be our preferred way to go.


	Unlike the JCPOA, which was broadly rejected across both sides of the aisle, an agreement that President Trump proposes would surely garner this type of widespread support from our elected leaders and the American people.


	In the strategy we laid out today, we want the support of our most important allies and partners in the region and around the globe. Certainly our European friends, but much more than that.


	I want the Australians, the Bahrainis, the Egyptians, the Indians, the Japanese, the Jordanians, the Kuwaitis, the Omanis, the Qataris, the Saudi Arabians, South Korea, the UAE, and many, many others worldwide to join in this effort against the Islamic Republic of Iran. I know that those countries share the same goals. They understand the challenge the same way that America does. Indeed, we welcome any nation which is sick and tired of the nuclear threats, the terrorism, the missile proliferation, and the brutality of a regime which is at odds with world peace, a country that continues to inflict chaos on innocent people.


	Indeed, while to some the changes in Iranian behavior we seek may seem unrealistic, we should recall that what we are pursuing was the global consensus before the JCPOA.


	For example, in 2012, President Obama said, quote, “The deal we’ll accept is [that] they end their nuclear program,” end of quote. That didn’t happen. In 2006, the P5 voted at the Security Council for Iran to immediately suspend all enrichment activities. That didn’t happen.


	In 2013, the French foreign minister said he was wary of being sucked into a, quote, “con game,” end of quote, over allowing Iran to continue uranium enrichment.


	In 2015, John Kerry said, quote, “We don’t recognize the right to enrich,” end of quote. Yet the Iranians are enriching even as we sit here today.


	So we’re not asking anything other than that Iranian behavior be consistent with global norms, global norms widely recognized before the JCPOA. And we want to eliminate their capacity to threaten our world with those nuclear activities.


	With respect to its nuclear activities, why would we allow Iran more capability than we have permitted the United Arab Emirates and that we’re asking for the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia? We understand that our reimposition of sanctions and the coming pressure campaign on the Iranian regime will pose financial and economic difficulties for a number of our friends. Indeed, it imposes economic challenges to America as well. These are markets our businesses would love to sell into as well. And we want to hear their concerns.


	But we will hold those doing prohibited business in Iran to account. Over the coming weeks, we will send teams of specialists to countries around the world to further explain administration policy, to discuss the implications of sanctions we imposition, and to listen.


	I know. I’ve spent a great deal of time with our allies in my first three weeks. I know that they may decide to try and keep their old nuclear deal going with Tehran. That is certainly their decision to make. They know where we stand.


	Next year marks the 40th anniversary of the Islamic Republic – Revolution in Iran. At this milestone, we have to ask: What has the Iranian Revolution given to the Iranian people? The regime reaps a harvest of suffering and death in the Middle East at the expense of its own citizens. Iran’s economy is stagnant and without direction and about to get worse. Its young people are withering under the weight of frustrated ambitions. They are longing to pursue the freedoms and opportunities of the 21st century.


	Iran’s leaders can change all of this if they choose to do so. Ali Khamenei has been supreme leader since 1989. He will not live forever, nor will the Iranian people abide the rigid rules of tyrants forever. For two generations, the Iranian regime has exacted a heavy toll on its own people and the world. The hard grip of repression is all that millions of Iranians have ever known.


	Now is the time for the supreme leader and the Iranian regime to summon the courage to do something historically beneficial for its own people, for this ancient and proud nation.


	As for the United States, our eyes are clear as to the nature of this regime, but our ears are open to what may be possible. Unlike the previous administration, we are looking for outcomes that benefit the Iranian people, not just the regime.


	If anyone, especially the leaders of Iran, doubts the President’s sincerity or his vision, let them look at our diplomacy with North Korea. Our willingness to meet with Kim Jong-un underscores the Trump administration’s commitment to diplomacy to help solve the greatest challenges, even with our staunchest adversaries. But that willingness, that willingness has been accompanied by a painful pressure campaign that reflects our commitment to resolve this challenge forever.


	To the ayatollah, to President Rouhani, and to other Iranian leaders: understand that your current activities will be met with steely resolve.


	My final message today is, in fact, to the Iranian people. I want to repeat President Trump’s words from October. President Trump said that, “We stand in total solidarity with the Iranian regime’s longest-suffering victims: its own people. The citizens of Iran have paid a heavy price for the violence and extremism of their leaders. The Iranian people long to reclaim their country’s proud history, its culture, its civilization, and its cooperation with its neighbors.”


	It is America’s hope that our labors toward peace and security will bear fruit for the long-suffering people of Iran. We long to see them prosper and flourish as in past decades and, indeed, as never before.


	Today, the United States of America is proud to take a new course towards that objective.


	Thank you. (Applause.)


MS JAMES: Thank you so very much. Bold, concise, unambiguous. We appreciate you taking this forum here at the Heritage Foundation to deliver that message. Looking at – and you listed during your speech several of our allies and friends and partners, many of whom are angry, some disappointed. How are you going to bring them on board? How are you going to use your best diplomatic skills to bring them along with us?


SECRETARY POMPEO: These strategic changes in the world come together when countries decide on an objective that is shared, and that always begins with a shared interest and values. I spent the first couple of weeks of my time as Secretary of State working to try to see if there wasn’t a way to fix the deal. I spoke with my European counterparts. I traveled there. In my 13th hour as Secretary of State I was on the ground in Brussels speaking with my European counterparts. We couldn’t get it done. We couldn’t reach agreement there.


	The United States intends to work hard at the diplomatic piece of working alongside all of our partners. We focus on the Europeans, but there are scores of countries around the world who share our concerns and are equally threatened by the Iranian regime. It’s that shared interest, it’s the value set which will ultimately drive, I believe, a global response to this – to the world’s largest state sponsor of terror. I’m convinced it can take place. My team is going to work diligently to do that. We’re going to do so in the context of trying to address the concerns of all of our partners, and I am convinced that over a period of time there will be a broad recognition that the strategy that President Trump has laid out is the right one that will put Iran in a place where it will one day rejoin civilization in the way that we all hope that it will.


MS JAMES: It’s clear through your comments this morning that you truly want tough sanctions. And I think that there is some remaining concern about how are you going to deal with the nuclear concerns. Can you speak to that for just a bit? And let me say to our audience, by the way, that I wish we had more time with the Secretary this morning, and there will be an abrupt and a hard stop because we have to get him out to the CIA and – for the swearing-in ceremony, and we don’t want you late for that.


	So talk to us about --


SECRETARY POMPEO: I got to go back one more time.


MS JAMES: One more time. (Laughter.)


SECRETARY POMPEO: Look, the nuclear file is imperative. It presents the largest, most severe threat for sure. The JCPOA fell short. It was a delay. Our aim is to get that permanently fixed. I mentioned quickly, right, we ask our other Middle Eastern partners to do hard things. We put a 123 agreement in front of them and say, “This is what you have to do.” And they say, “Hey, the Iranians enrich.” That’s reasonable. That seems to me a reasonable point.


	Well, our demands on Iran aren’t unreasonable. Give up your program. End it. Should they choose to go back, should they begin to enrich, we’re fully prepared to respond to that as well. I’m certainly not going to share with you today precisely what our response will be. But we watch them talk. We’ve heard them say – I hope that they’ll make a different decision, that they’ll choose a different path. We welcome them taking a path that other nations in the region are beginning to take as well.


MS JAMES: Well, can you explain for us the sanctions structure and how you intend to target the Iranian regime without hurting our European friends?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Well, any time sanctions are put in place, countries have to give up economic activity. So the Americans have given up economic activity now for an awfully long time, and I’ll concede there are American companies who would love to do business with the Islamic Republic of Iran. There’s a huge market there. It’s a big, vibrant, wonderful peoples. But everyone is going to have to participate in this. Every country is going to have to understand that we cannot continue to create wealth for Qasem Soleimani.


	Right, that’s what this is. At the end of the day, this money has flowed to him. The economics have permitted them to run roughshod across the Middle East. Our effort is to strangle his economic capacity to do harm to the Middle East and to the world. Nuclear programs aren’t cheap. To the extent we are effective at making it more difficult on the Iranian regime, we will reduce their capacity to continue to build out their nuclear weapon system as well.


MS JAMES: You’ve laid out a very, very bold plan this morning. Do you have a timeframe for getting all this done?


SECRETARY POMPEO: So the sanctions are back in place and are winding down over the next 100 and what, 55 days? There are – there’s lots more work in place. It is a effort across all of government. We are working certainly diplomatically in the lead, but Department of Commerce, Department of Defense, each of us has the same mission from President Trump. I can’t put a timeline on it. But at the end of the day, the Iranian people will decide the timeline. At the end of the day, the Iranian people will get to make a choice about their leadership. If they make the decision quickly, that would be wonderful. If they choose not to do so, we will stay hard at this until we achieve the outcomes that I set forward today.


MS JAMES: Well, Mr. Secretary, again, on behalf of the Heritage Foundation and the scholars here who have been working on these issues for a very long time, we want to thank you. Again, it was a bold vision – clear, concise, unambiguous – and we want to congratulate you and the President, and we wish you Godspeed.


	I am going to ask you to remain seated while the Secretary exits. I have about eight more questions here, but --


SECRETARY POMPEO: For another day.


MS JAMES: For another day.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Thank you all very much for being here.


MS JAMES: Thank you so much. (Applause.)

	The United States condemns the fraudulent election that took place in Venezuela on May 20. This so-called “election” is an attack on constitutional order and an affront to Venezuela’s tradition of democracy. Until the Maduro regime restores a democratic path in Venezuela through free, fair, and transparent elections, the government faces isolation from the international community.


	Sunday’s process was choreographed by a regime too unpopular and afraid of its own people to risk free elections and open competition. It stacked the Venezuelan courts and National Electoral Council with biased members aligned with the regime. It silenced dissenting voices. It banned major opposition parties and leaders from participating. As of May 14, more than 338 political prisoners remained jailed, more than in all other countries in the hemisphere combined. The regime stifled the free press. State sources dominated media coverage, unfairly favoring the incumbent. Most contemptible of all, the regime selectively parceled out food to manipulate the votes of hungry Venezuelans.


	The Maduro regime fails to defend the Venezuelan people’s right to democracy as reflected in the Inter-American Democratic Charter. The United States stands with democratic nations in support of the Venezuelan people and will take swift economic and diplomatic actions to support the restoration of their democracy.

SECRETARY POMPEO: Well, good morning. Good morning, Prime Minister. Welcome and congratulations on your hundredth anniversary of your independence. That’s a major milestone along the way. The message, frankly, this morning is that America’s support for Georgia remains strong and steadfast and will continue to do so.


	As Vice President Pence said during his visit to Tbilisi last July, we’re with you, we stand with you, we are proud of our friendship and strategic partnership with the nation and the people of Georgia.


	Today I’m pleased to join the prime minister in conducting the seventh plenary session of the U.S.-Georgia Strategic Partnership Commission. This year is significant in another solemn way as well. 2018 marks the tenth anniversary of Russia’s invasion of Georgia. The United States unequivocally condemns Russia’s occupation on Georgian soil. Russia’s forcible invasion of Georgia is a clear violation of international peace and security and goes against the basic principles of the Charter of the United Nations and the Helsinki Final Act.


	The Russian-occupied Georgian territories of Abkhazia and South Ossetia are integral parts of Georgia. The United States supports Georgia’s sovereignty and territorial integrity with its internationally recognized borders. We call on Russia to fulfill all of its obligations under the 2008 ceasefire agreement to withdraw its forces to pre-conflict positions, to reverse its recognition of the Georgian regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia as independent states, and to provide free access for humanitarian assistance to each of those two regions.


	The United States and NATO depend on strong, willing, resilient partners to help safeguard our common security interests. Georgia is one of those steadfast partners. It has demonstrated its commitment to contribute to international security and uphold Western values. Georgia is the largest non-NATO state troop contributor to Afghanistan, serving without any caveats about the duty – 32 Georgia soldiers who made the ultimate sacrifice in pursuit of peace and stability there. The United States honors Georgia’s sacrifice and we are deeply grateful for Georgia’s steadfast support on this important joint mission. The United States and Georgia continue to deepen our security relationship, including through cooperation on fighting global terrorism, stemming the flow of foreign fighters crossing Georgian territory and countering the smuggling of dangerous nuclear materials from the Soviet Union.


	In parliamentary and local elections in 2016 and last year, the Georgian people reaffirmed their Euro-Atlantic choice, including Georgia’s future membership in NATO. Our resolve remains. President Trump stands by the 2008 Bucharest declaration and the United States looks forward to one day welcoming Georgia into NATO. During our meeting today, we will discuss all the links between national security, a vibrant economy, and democracy. We know that an open society and a strong economy together are foundational elements for Georgia’s security. The rule of law, combined with an independent judiciary, accountable government, and respect for pluralism are essential for democratic and economic advancement.


	To create an even more resilient democracy, the United States encourages Georgia to create opportunities for all voices to be heard in politics, in media, and to strengthen checks and balances in government institutions. Despite Russian occupation of 20 percent of its territory, Georgia has continued to reform. Its success carries with it great responsibility to fulfill the expectations of – to the Georgian people and to deliver economic prosperity and governmental transparency. Our two countries’ prime ministers are close partners and friends. The United States has stood with Georgia for a quarter century, and under President Trump, we will continue to stand with you as partners, friends, and one day as NATO allies as well.


	Thank you, Prime Minister.


PRIME MINISTER KVIRIKASHVILI: Thank you, Secretary Pompeo, for your very encouraging words. I would like to thank you for your readiness to convene the plenary session of the strategic partnership council – commission between our countries in your early days of your appointment – up to your appointment in this office. I would like to congratulate you on this appointment to the very important position not only for the United States, but for the world. I am convinced that your vigor and determination will reaffirm U.S. strong leadership position throughout the world and will further lead towards the deeper – even deeper partnership between the United States and Georgia.


	In a few days, as you mentioned, we will celebrate the hundred years anniversary of the establishment of the first Democratic Republic of Georgia. We have come a long way to become proud partner and strong ally of the United States. Under the leadership of President Trump, the strategic partnership between our nations has advanced significantly. Looking ahead, we see the great potential to strengthen our relations further, in line with the strategic interests of both countries. And today’s session provides a great opportunity not only to review the progress achieved, but also set the priorities for deepening our ties. Thanks to the U.S.’s continued support, Georgia has consolidated its democracy, strengthened governmental institutions and created more opportunities for economic development not only for Georgia, but for the region as well.


	We are proud to be in the list of top reformer countries of the world, and the United States is proud shareholder of this success. Georgia highly values sustained and unequivocal U.S. support for our territorial integrity and sovereignty. The United States support to the process of the peaceful resolution of the conflict with the Russian Federation, the occupation of Georgian territories, Abkhazia and Tskhinvali regions, is of highest importance to our country and regional stability. Our nations share the goal of preserving peace and stability around the world. We continue to fight terrorism shoulder to shoulder with each other in Afghanistan, where both countries suffered significant casualties. Our bilateral and multilateral defense cooperation is helping Georgia to modernize our armed forces and build our deterrence capabilities.


	A few days ago, Army General Scaparrotti, the commander of U.S. European Command, was in Georgia to launch the Georgia Defense Readiness Program, a historical program and training initiative. This marks the beginning of a new era of partnership between our countries, which contributes to the security of Black Sea region, and thus the stability of the greater European security environment. We are at stage where we are ready to make an even more impressive leap in our bilateral and multilateral defense and security cooperation. We have made significant progress in enhancing our NATO interoperability. We are already exceeding NATO standard of spending 2 percent of GDP on defense budget, including more than 20 percent on the equipment. We are pleased to have the opportunity to buy the U.S. military defense equipment. U.S. plays an important role in our Euro-Atlantic integration process.


	As we approach the NATO Brussels summit this year, we are looking to the reflection of the great progress we achieved on the NATO membership path. Georgia’s membership in NATO will be a clear added value for the Euro-Atlantic security, and I would like to thank you, Secretary Pompeo, for your reassuring words (inaudible) on Georgia’s NATO membership.


	The other area where we enjoyed great support from the United States is the economic transformation and education. The U.S. assistance helped Georgia to become one of the most investor and business-friendly places in the world. Today, as we are turning a new page in our relations, we see significant progress for deepening – potential for deepening our bilateral ties. U.S. private investments in such infrastructure projects like the Anaklia Deep Sea Port will advance further America strategic economic interest in the region.


	As a gateway to Eurasia, that possesses a far-reaching and unique FTA network from the EU to China. Complimentary to the U.S. FTA network, Georgia is a perfect foothold for the U.S. businesses to enter the wider region. Georgia is one of the few countries in the world with the institutions, policies and business climate necessary for comprehensive and fair trade deal with the United States. In case of a free trade agreement between our two countries, according to the recent study performed by the PricewaterhouseCoopers, exports of the United States goods can grow by 360 percent in just five years, creating new jobs in the United States.


	Mr. Secretary, the potential for future cooperation is great for both nations, and I look forward to working with you on all directions in the interests of people of America and Georgia. And of course, I look forward to seeing you in Georgia. Thank you very much.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Great, thank you. Thank you very much. I’m sure we’ll see you again. Thank you.


PRIME MINISTER KVIRIKASHVILI: Thank you.

	For those observing this month, it is a time of reverence, generosity, and spiritual introspection. Ramadan is also a cherished time of community, often spent reconnecting with family and friends. It calls Muslims to come together to give charitably to the less fortunate.


	Muslims in the United States and around the world make valuable contributions to their societies every day, and millions will honor this month in a special way with acts of service and giving back to their neighbors. In recognition of this, every year many of our embassies and consulates around the world host Ramadan activities bringing together Muslims and people of other faiths who are committed to our shared goal of fostering peace, stability, and prosperity. These conversations and collaborations are one of the core strengths of our diplomacy, paving the way for stronger communities through partnerships and respect for diversity.

QUESTION: And joining us now, the new and very busy Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. Mr. Secretary, welcome back to Fox News Sunday.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Good morning, Chris. It’s great to be with you.


QUESTION: Let’s start with breaking news. First of all, that savage attack last night in Paris, a Chechen knifing killing one person, wounding four others. What can you tell us about a possible link to terror?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Well, we don’t know much more. We know that the caliphate ISIS has claimed responsibility. They said he was one of their soldiers. We can’t verify that yet. The French authorities, with all the intelligence help the United States can provide, we’ll do our best to unpack this in the coming hours.


QUESTION: Okay, let’s talk about some other breaking news. The North Koreans announced yesterday that they are going to blow up their nuclear site in 10 to 12 days. How big a development is this, and is that, do we believe, their only nuclear test site?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Chris, it’s good news. Every single site that the North Koreans have that can inflict risk upon the American people that is destroyed, eliminated, dismantled is good news for the American people and for the world. And so this is one step along the way. I had a good set of meetings this past week aimed at heading in exactly this direction.


QUESTION: I want to go back to the comment – and Kevin just played it – your comment on Friday that if Kim chooses the, quote, “right path,” the U.S. is prepared to work with North Korea to, quote, “achieve prosperity.” What does that mean in terms of direct U.S. investment in North Korea? And are we, as part of this, willing, in effect, to guarantee Kim’s security, that regime change will be off the table?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Chris, here’s what this will look like. This will be Americans coming in – private sector Americans, not the U.S. taxpayer – private sector Americans coming in to help build out the energy grid – they need enormous amounts of electricity in North Korea; to work with them to develop infrastructure, all the things that the North Korean people need, the capacity for American agriculture to support North Korea so they can eat meat and have healthy lives. Those are the kind of things that, if we get what it is the President has demanded – the complete, verifiable, irreversible denuclearization of North Korea – that the American people will offer in spades.


QUESTION: And as part of that, are we, in effect, saying to Kim, “If you give us what we want, you can stay on in power?”


SECRETARY POMPEO: We will have to provide security assurances to be sure. This has been a tradeoff that has been pending for 25 years. No president has ever put America in a position where the North Korean leadership thought that this was truly possible, that the Americans would actually do this, would lead to the place where America was no longer held at risk by the North Korean regime. That’s the objectives. When I said earlier this week that I think Chairman Kim shares the objectives with the American people, I am convinced of that. Now the task is for President Trump and he to meet to validate the process by which this would go forward, to set out those markers so that we can negotiate this outcome.


QUESTION: Do you have any problem, given Kim’s history and the history of his family as an oppressive regime, any problems with the idea of the U.S., even if we get our deal, in effect, giving a security guarantee to the Kim regime?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Look, we’ll have to see how the negotiations proceed, but make no mistake about it: America’s interest here is preventing the risk that North Korea will launch a nuclear weapon into LA or Denver or into the very place we’re sitting here this morning, Chris. That’s our objective, that’s the end state the President has laid out, and that’s the mission that he sent me on this past week to put us on the trajectory to go achieve that.


QUESTION: Let’s talk about denuclearization, the objective. Two weeks ago, National Security Advisor John Bolton sat in this very seat, and he told me that the U.S. negotiating position going in is that Kim has to ship out, has to dismantle and take out of the country all of his nuclear weapons, all of his nuclear infrastructure, all of his long-range missiles before the U.S. will grant any concessions. On the other hand, this week, Kim met with Chinese President Xi and he called for, quote, “phased and synchronous measures,” in other words, action for action. Have you and Kim agreed what the sequencing is? Is it all of the actions by him first, or is it step by step? And is that something, as I say, that you’ve agreed with, or is it something that Kim and the President will have to work out at the summit?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Chris, we’ve had discussions on how this would proceed. There’s still a great deal of detail to be worked on, and in the coming weeks we will continue to work on that so that we can be in a good spot on June 12th in Singapore for President Trump. But make no mistake about it: We’ve done this before, right? We’ve done trade for trade, moment for moment; you give me X, I give you Y; and it has failed repeatedly. I think Chairman Kim understands that. I think he appreciates the fact that this is going to have to be different and big and special, and something that has never been undertaken before. If we’re going to get to this historic outcome, both sides have to be prepared to take truly historic measures to achieve it.


QUESTION: And how confident are you? Because you’re going to be putting the President of the United States in a room with Kim in Singapore with the whole world watching. How confident are you that not only he understands it, but that he’s going to have to – that he’s going to deliver on our expectations?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Well, to quote President Trump, we’ll see, right? We are not to the place yet where we should be remotely close to declaring that we have achieved what it is we want. There’s a great deal of work that remains. Our eyes are wide open with respect to the risks. But it is our fervent hope that Chairman Kim wants to make a strategic change, a strategic change in the direction for his country and his people; and if he’s prepared to do that, President Trump is prepared to assure that this could be a successful transition.


QUESTION: All right, I want to talk about that. You’ve said that we understand, and John Bolton talked about that nobody in the administration is starry-eyed. The President has been raising expectations for the summit, saying he thinks that they’re going to make a great deal – his phrase. Your predecessor at the CIA, John Brennan, says he thinks that’s playing into Kim’s hands. Take a look:


PRESIDENT TRUMP: “I think that we’re going to have a success. I think this will be a very big success.”


MR BRENNAN: “I think he has been masterful in how he has manipulated perceptions and how he has manipulated and, quite frankly, duped Mr. Trump.”


QUESTION: Is it a mistake for the President to predict a, quote, “great success”?


SECRETARY POMPEO: I think Former Director Brennan’s remarks are silly on their face. We’re going to enter into a set of discussions with two nations doing their best to achieve outcomes for their own people that are consistent with their objectives and goals. I think we now understand that there is the potential that there are shared objectives, and our mission is to prepare the groundwork. And we’re pretty far along the way in doing so, and we’ll continue to work in the days ahead – 30 left – to prepare for June 12th so the President can have a successful outcome, that the two of them can meet and see if there is sufficient overlap so that we can achieve the ultimate objective for the American people.


QUESTION: After you brought the American hostages home and the whole world celebrated that, President Trump praised Kim for releasing them. And that praise – not the release of the hostages, but that praise – upset some critics. Take a look at this:


PRESIDENT TRUMP: “Kim Jong-un did a great service to himself, to his country, by doing this.”


SENATOR SCHUMER: “We can’t be fooled into giving the North Korean regime credit for returning Americans that never should have been detained in the first place.”


QUESTION: According to your State Department’s latest report, North Korea still holds at least 80,000 political prisoners in its labor camps and other facilities. Is human rights an issue in this summit, or is this just going to be about the nuclear issue?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Yeah, Chris, this administration is always concerned about human rights. It’s the case not only are there political prisoners that remain in North Korea, there are Americans held around the world by other rogue regimes too. I can assure you this administration – I saw it in my role as director of the CIA and I’ve seen it now in my first two and a half weeks as Secretary of State – is intently focused on achieving the return of each of those as well. We had a success this week. We’re happy for those families and for America that those three Americans returned home, but we recognize there’s much work to do. We still have Americans held and we’re working diligently on behalf of each and every one of them.


QUESTION: When people found out that you were going to be on the program today they all had the same question. I must say I did. What is Kim like? With the possible exception of Dennis Rodman, you have spent more time with him than any other Westerner, at least two and a half hours the way I figure it. What is he like? Give us any kind of personal insight. How aware is he of what President Trump has been saying? Was there any mention of Little Rocket Man?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Well, I’ve got a lot fewer rebounds than Dennis Rodman, but I did get to spend a great deal of time with Chairman Kim. The conversations are professional. He knows – he knows his brief. He knows what the – what he is trying to achieve for the North Korean people. He is able to deal with complexity when the conversation requires it.


	He does follow the Western press. He’ll probably watch this show at some point. He’s paying attention to things that the world is saying. He too is preparing for June 12th. He and his team will be working with them to put our two leaders in a position where it’s just possible we might pull off a historic undertaking.


QUESTION: Was there any mention of the exchange of insults back and forth?


SECRETARY POMPEO: No, we didn’t cover that, Chris.


QUESTION: That’s probably wise. (Laughter.) I want to turn to – there’s a lot on your brief. Iran and Israel got into an armed conflict across the Syrian border this week after President Trump pulled out of the nuclear deal with Tehran. Do you think that there’s any connection that Iran feels less constrained now that the U.S. no longer is part of this deal about Iran nukes?


SECRETARY POMPEO: That’s ludicrous. That’s ludicrous to suggest that Iran feels less constrained when during the JCPOA they have now fired missiles into an airport where Americans travel each day in Riyadh, they’ve now fired missiles into Israel; to suggest that somehow the withdrawal from the JCPOA is driving the Iranian conduct that’s taken place during the JCPOA in Yemen, the rise of Hizballah – all of those things took place during the JCPOA. Indeed, I would argue that they felt they could act with impunity. They watched. They watched Europe put exactly zero sanctions on their missile program during the JCPOA. I think Rouhani and Zarif need to explain why it’s the case that while this agreement was in place Iran continued its march across the Middle East.


QUESTION: President Trump made it clear that he’s not only going after Iran but he’s also prepared to sanction European companies that continue to do business in Tehran. Here is the President: “We will be instituting the highest level of economic sanction. Any nation that helps Iran in its quest for nuclear weapons could also be strongly sanctioned by the United States.”


	But the leaders of France, of Germany, of Britain all say that they’re going to stay in the deal and they’re going to look for a way to protect European companies that continue to do business. The question is: How hard is the Trump administration prepared to go after European companies that ignore the U.S. pulling out?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Two things, Chris. First, the wealth that was created in Iran as a result of the JCPOA drove Iranian malign activity. It fueled Qasem Soleimani. It fueled the IRGC. It provided resources for their work in Syria and Iraq. President Trump’s withdrawal is aimed at denying them that wealth, denying them the resources to continue their bad behavior, to take the money away from them.


	The withdrawal wasn’t aimed at the Europeans. I worked hard over the short time I’ve been the Secretary of State to try and fix the deal. We couldn’t reach agreement with our E3 partners. I am hopeful in the days and weeks ahead we can come up with a deal that really works, that really protects the world from Iranian bad behavior, not just their nuclear program but their missiles and their malign behavior as well.


QUESTION: But what about --


SECRETARY POMPEO: And I’ll be working closely with the Europeans to try and achieve that, Chris.


QUESTION: But what about if the European companies and the European countries say look, there’s not going to be a renegotiation any more than there’s going to be a renegotiation of the Paris Climate Accord? Is the U.S. prepared to go after companies in our allies like Britain, France, and Germany, if they try to continue to do business?


SECRETARY POMPEO: The sanctions regime that is now in place is very clear about what the requirements are. My mission that I’ve been given by President Trump is to work to strike a deal that achieves the outcomes that protect America. That’s what we’re going to do, and I’ll be hard at it with the Europeans in the next several days.


QUESTION: A couple of final questions. Israel. The U.S. opens its embassy in Jerusalem tomorrow. The Palestinians are talking about a day of rage, violent mass protests, and the PLO won’t even talk to the U.S. anymore as an interlocutor in terms of the Middle East. Is the peace process dead? And given the threat of violence, what are you as the Secretary of State saying to Americans in the Middle East in those parts of the world over the next few days?


SECRETARY POMPEO: So the peace process is most decidedly not dead. We’re hard at work on it. We hope we can achieve a successful outcome there as well. With respect to security, we are aware of the situation on the ground. The United States Government has taken a number of actions to ensure that not only our governmental interests but the American people in that region are secure as well, and we’re comfortable we’ve taken action that reduces that risk.


QUESTION: Finally – and it’s pretty remarkable given all that’s happened, all that’s on your brief – you have been Secretary of State for barely two weeks now. What’s your vision for the State Department?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Well, first, Chris, I hope I haven’t peaked in my first two weeks. (Laughter.) But it’s pretty clear: We’ve got to go put the diplomatic team on the playing field. It should be the United States State Department that is at the front of American foreign policy, delivering solutions to solve America’s problems without resort to military force. And so I’m going to build the team, we’re going to get our swagger back, and the State Department will be out in front in every corner of the world leading America’s diplomatic policy, achieving great outcomes on behalf of President Trump and America.


QUESTION: Secretary Pompeo, thank you. Thanks for your time in a very busy schedule.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Thank you.


QUESTION: Always good to talk with you, sir.

QUESTION: We want to welcome Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, our first guest here in the new Face the Nation studio. Mr. Secretary, thank you for joining us.


SECRETARY POMPEO: It’s great to be with you. Happy Mother’s Day. It’s a beautiful studio.


QUESTION: Thank you. Thank you. It’s been an extraordinary week for you on many fronts. I want to ask you about North Korea. They have, in the past, pledged to dismantle nuclear sites before. They’re saying they’re going to do it again. It this latest pledge a theatrical gesture, or is it significant?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Well, my trip was designed to lay the groundwork to prepare for the President’s meeting with Chairman Kim on June 12th, now just 30 days away. We have seen this happen before. We have our eyes wide open with respect to the fact that the North Koreans have not proved worthy of their promises. But we’re hopeful that this will be different, that we won’t do the traditional model where they do something, and we give them a bunch of money, and then both sides walk away. We’re hoping this will be bigger, different, faster. Our ask is complete and total denuclearization of North Korea, and it is the President’s intention to achieve that. As he has said, we’ll see if that works, but we’re setting conditions for a successful meeting between the two leaders.


QUESTION: Have you defined denuclearization?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Yeah. Total, full, complete.


QUESTION: That means full dismantling --


SECRETARY POMPEO: Yes.


QUESTION: -- stopping computer modeling --


SECRETARY POMPEO: Yeah.


QUESTION: -- getting rid of the centrifuges --


SECRETARY POMPEO: Yeah.


QUESTION: -- stopping all enrichment, getting inspectors on the ground?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Yes, ma’am, the same deal we should have done with Iran.


QUESTION: So for you, you’ve talked about making it worth North Korea’s while financially --


SECRETARY POMPEO: Mm-hmm.


QUESTION: -- if they follow through. John Bolton said today on another network that no one should look to the U.S. for economic aid, including North Korea.


SECRETARY POMPEO: That’s right.


QUESTION: How do you reconcile those two things. They seem to be in contrast.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Oh, it’s very, very – no, no. Oh, no, ma’am. Very, very consistent. What Chairman Kim will get from America is our finest – our entrepreneurs, our risk-takers, our capital providers, not our taxpayers. They’ll get people who --


QUESTION: Private capital?


SECRETARY POMPEO: They will get private capital that comes in. North Korea is desperately in need of energy support, electricity for their people. They are – they’re in great need of agricultural equipment and technology, the finest from the Midwest that I come from. We can deliver that. And as I said earlier this week, we can create conditions for real economic prosperity for the North Korean people that will rival that of the South, and that is our expectation. It won’t be U.S. taxpayers. It will be American know-how, knowledge, entrepreneurs, and risk-takers working alongside the North Korean people to create a robust economy for their people, too.


QUESTION: That sounds like sanctions relief --


SECRETARY POMPEO: Well --


QUESTION: -- to make it possible for a company to invest directly in North Korea when we do that --


SECRETARY POMPEO: Ma’am, if we get denuclearization, of course, there will be sanctions relief, certainly. There’ll be more than that. There’ll be a real – the President has a commitment, and he will make this commitment to Chairman Kim, I am confident, that says if you do the things we need to do so that America is no longer held at risk by your nuclear weapons arsenal, and that you get rid of your CBW program and missiles that threaten the world, we will ensure that your people have the opportunity for the greatness that I know Chairman Kim wants them to have.


QUESTION: Not many secretaries of state get to say they brought three Americans home in their second week on the job or have even been to North Korea twice in six weeks’ time. But I’m wondering, in your interactions with Kim, because you’ve had them directly, have you assured him that the U.S. isn’t trying to oust him from power?


SECRETARY POMPEO: I have told him that what President Trump wants is to see the North Korean regime get rid of its nuclear weapons program in completely and in totality; and in exchange for that, we are prepared to ensure that the North Korean people get the opportunity that they so richly deserve. It’s pretty straightforward, and I said earlier this week I think in that sense Chairman Kim shares that same objective. I think he understands that President Trump has put an enormous pressure campaign in place with the aim of achieving a good outcome for North Korea and its people. That’s our objective. That’s the American goal that President Trump set forward.


QUESTION: So the U.S. no longer believes that Kim Jong-un is holding on to these weapons to secure his place in power? In other words, you are saying no regime change?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Only time will tell how these negotiations will proceed. The President uses the language, says we’ll see. We’re – there’s still a lot of work to do. The American leadership under President Trump has its eyes wide open. It could be that we won’t be successful. It’s possible; we acknowledge that. We’ve watched this fail before. But the model that has been employed here is fundamentally different, and we are hopeful that we will get a fundamentally different outcome.


QUESTION: What will this summit in Singapore look like? Are you walking into the room with President Trump to sit across from Kim Jong-un?


SECRETARY POMPEO: I don’t know.


QUESTION: You don’t know yet?


SECRETARY POMPEO: I don’t know. We’re working on the details, the actual blocking and tackling of the meeting. We have been working on them for weeks. We’ll have teams working on them in the days and weeks ahead. We’ve got now some 30 days, I guess it is, and there will be a great deal of work done between our two countries between now and then to finally set the stage for what we hope will be a very successful visit in Singapore between our two leaders.


QUESTION: So you’re still figuring out the protocol, but you spent the most time with Kim Jong-un.


SECRETARY POMPEO: And I’ve --


QUESTION: What has struck you about him?


SECRETARY POMPEO: What struck me about – me is very knowledgeable in the sense of he knows the files. He’s very capable of engaging in complex set of discussions. When I ask him a question about something that’s a little off, he answers it. There’s no notecards. It is Chairman Kim, in this case, interacting with me directly, having a robust discussion about what the outlines of a successful negotiation between our two countries might ultimately be.


QUESTION: You brought those three Americans home from North Korea. There are still at least four Americans being held in Iran. Their families are concerned that tearing up this diplomacy, exiting the nuclear deal, puts their loved ones at risk. What can you tell them?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Two things. First, everyone should know that this administration is intent on bringing home every American who is held anywhere in the world. We’ve got Pastor Brunson in Turkey that we desperately need to get back. We have others held in Iran and in Syria. We are working diligently to get each of them back.


	With respect to whether the actions of this past week with respect to the JCPOA increased anyone’s risk, I think that’s ludicrous. The Iranian bad behavior increased, it only increased, during the time of the JCPOA.


QUESTION: Are you willing – are you willing to carry out a prisoner swap with Iran still?


SECRETARY POMPEO: I can’t answer that question. We didn’t exchange anything for these North Korean detainees. They came back because Chairman Kim thought it was in his best interest to do so, and we are thankful for that. And we are hopeful that Mr. Rouhani, who fancies himself a Westerner, would undertake to release the Iranian detainees as well. He talks about the fact that he wants European business there. The least he could do would be to return all of the people that his country, Mr. Rouhani’s country, has hold of.


QUESTION: Fundamentally, a number of our European allies, as you know – I’m sure you’ve had some difficult conversations in the past few days – have been frustrated that the U.S. cut short the diplomacy, in their view. They said in a conversation with you last Friday you assured them that they had – they were close to this side deal to address the things President Trump was worried about. Why not try it? Why not finish that? Why did the President cut that off?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Oh, Margaret, we did. We did try. The President set out a set of objectives. He tasked me in my first couple weeks to work with the Europeans to try and do it, although the work had been ongoing before I arrived at the State Department. And at no time were we able to reach an agreement. The Europeans simply wouldn’t accede to the requirements to fix the deal. And so they had some 90 days to do so. We were --


QUESTION: Mm-hmm. They thought they had another five days and could get there on the sunset clause.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Margaret, we had 90 days to work at it. And you should know we will continue to work. President Trump and President Macron have both said we want to get a deal that’s right, a bigger deal. We will be hard at that in the weeks ahead. I hope to be a central part of achieving that. It would be a wonderful thing if we could get the Europeans to do this.


	But Margaret, I do want to add this: Fundamentally, what’s happened during the time of the JCPOA was that the Iranian wealth creation fueled their malign behavior. The money that they had to go and launch missiles into Riyadh and Israel – putting Americans at risk – was provided by the economic benefits they got from the JCPOA. President Trump wants to starve them of that wealth.


QUESTION: So fundamentally though, are you trying to negotiate a new nuclear deal, or are you trying to put together a coalition to defeat Iran?


SECRETARY POMPEO: We are going to put together a coalition that pushes back against not only Iran’s nuclear program – which, by the way, Margaret, they still deny. No Iranian leader has admitted they had a weapons program, and the facts are now public that they did. They ought to at least be honest about that. But it’s not going to just be the nuclear file. It will be their missile program. It will be their effort to build Hizballah. It’ll be their threats against Israel. It’ll be the work that they’re doing in Yemen to launch missiles into Saudi Arabia, for goodness sakes.


	This is the activity that the Iranian regime has undertaken during the JCPOA. We’re going to make a shift. We’re going to deny them the benefit of the economic wealth that has been created and put real pressure, so that they’ll stop the full scale of the sponsorship of terrorism with which they’ve been engaged in these past years.


QUESTION: Mr. Secretary, thank you for coming on Face the Nation.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Thank you very much, Margaret. Happy Mother’s Day to you.


QUESTION: Thank you.

SECRETARY POMPEO: Good afternoon. It is my honor to welcome Foreign Minister Kang to Washington. It is important to meet with such a critical ally so early in my time as Secretary at this incredibly critical time as well. Our alliance with the Republic of Korea was forged in the crucible of war 65 years ago. Tens of thousands of Koreans and Americans sacrificed their lives in the pursuit of freedom for South Korea.


	In the years since, the citizens of South Korea took the hard-earned freedom and transformed their war-shattered country into an economic wonder. The Republic of Korea is now the 11th largest economy in the globe, the sixth largest trading partner of the United States, and a key force multiplier for U.S. leadership in the world. The U.S.-Republic of Korea alliance has been fortified by the trials of history and is unequivocally now stronger than ever. Over 28,500 men and women of the United States Forces Korea serve as the forward-deployed face of the ironclad U.S. commitment to the security of the Republic of Korea, its people, and indeed to the entire region.


	The prospect of peace and security in the Korean Peninsula and across the Asia Pacific region is why we have stood shoulder to shoulder for more than six decades. Just yesterday, I returned from Pyongyang, where I had productive discussions with Chairman Kim Jong-un in preparation for President Trump’s summit with him. It was an honor as one of my first actions as Secretary of State to negotiate the safe return of three U.S. citizens and bring them home to freedom. We wish these Americans and their families the best as they reconnect after a very difficult time apart. On behalf of the American people, we say welcome home.


	The release of these three citizens helps set the conditions for a successful meeting between President Trump and Chairman Kim. We look forward to our continued preparations with the DPRK to make the summit in Singapore on June 12th a true success for the American and Korean people and for the world. I congratulate South Korea and North Korea on their historic meeting last month. The United States is encouraged by President Moon and Chairman Kim’s stated goal of complete denuclearization in the Panmunjom declaration.


	Today, Foreign Minister Kang and I discussed the summit, my trip to North Korea, and the bold step President Trump is about to take when he meets with Chairman Kim. We would not be where we are today without the close and coordinated leadership of Presidents Trump and Moon. The United States and the Republic of Korea remain committed to achieving the permanent, verifiable, and irreversible denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. If Chairman Kim chooses the right path, there is a future brimming with peace and prosperity for the North Korea – North Korean people. America’s track record of support for the Korean people is second to none.


	If North Korea takes bold action to quickly denuclearize, the United States is prepared to work with North Korea to achieve prosperity on the par with our South Korean friends. The United States looks forward to continued close cooperation with our South Korean allies on this issue and many others.


	Foreign Minister, thank you for being with me today. It was a pleasure to work with you.


FOREIGN MINISTER KANG: Thank you very much, Mr. Secretary, for the very warm welcome. Let me reiterate my congratulations on your becoming the top diplomat of the United States at this historic moment. Secretary Pompeo, you have already been at the center of our joint efforts on North Korea, and I very much look forward to working closely with you.


	We spoke on April 28th right after the momentous inter-Korean summit, and today we met just after Secretary Pompeo’s return from Pyongyang. During our meeting, I congratulated him and President Trump for the successful release of the three U.S. citizens, all Korean Americans, from North Korea. This is a promising signal for the upcoming summit between President Trump and Chairman Kim.


	Over the past weeks, both Korea and the United States have been engaged in intensive diplomatic efforts regarding North Korea, and we briefed each other on the latest endeavors, including Secretary Pompeo’s visit to Pyongyang and the Korea-Japan-China trilateral summit in Tokyo, which adopted a special statement welcoming the outcome of the South-North Korean summit and expressing the strong hopes for the success of the upcoming U.S.-North Korea summit. In this context, Secretary Pompeo and I discussed preparations for the summit meeting between President Trump and Chairman Kim in Singapore on June 12th. We agreed that the summit would be a historic opportunity for resolving the North Korean nuclear issue and securing enduring peace on the Korean Peninsula. We reaffirmed that our goal is to achieve the complete, verifiable, and irreversible denuclearization on the Korean Peninsula.


	In this regard, Secretary Pompeo and I agreed the next few weeks will be critical, requiring air-tight coordination between our two countries. As announced, President Moon will visit Washington, D.C. soon to meet with President Trump. The close communication and trust between Presidents Trump and Moon have been the driving force that has brought us to this point of breakthrough for the denuclearization and peace on the Korean Peninsula. So their meeting on the 22nd will be instrumental in preparing for a successful U.S.-North Korea summit.


	Secretary Pompeo and I reaffirmed that the ROK-U.S. alliance, which celebrates its 65th anniversary this year, has long served as the linchpin for peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula and in the region. We also reaffirmed that for the last 65 years, the USFK, the United States Forces in Korea, has played a crucial role for deterrence and peace and stability of the region, and we would like to emphasize again that the U.S. military presence in Korea is a matter for the ROK-U.S. alliance first and foremost.


	After today’s meeting, I am even more confident that our alliance is as robust as ever and that there is no daylight in our cooperation on the denuclearization and peace on the Korean Peninsula.


	Once again, I would like to thank Secretary Pompeo for today’s fruitful discussions and look forward to building a close working partnership relationship with him. And in addition to the upcoming summit meeting in Washington, D.C. on May 22nd, I hope to see him again in Seoul and reciprocate the hospitality very soon. Thank you very much.


MS NAUERT: Thank you. And we have time for two questions total. The first goes to Rich Edson from Fox News Channel. Rich.


QUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Secretary. You just mentioned and have mentioned before, as have the South Koreans, that you are looking for permanent, verifiable, irreversible denuclearization. How does the United States specifically define that? Is it inspections, full facility dismantling? Is it more than that, less than that? And also, you have had more substantive conversations with Kim Jong-un than arguably any other Westerner. What is your impression of him? Do you think he’s rational? And simply, what’s it like to talk to him?


	And to the foreign minister, are South Korea and regional allies discussing providing any sanctions relief to North Korea before the summit between President Trump and Kim Jong-un, and what kind of outcome does South Korea need to secure its security, and does that include the maintenance of current U.S. military assets in the region? Thank you very much.


SECRETARY POMPEO: So I have spent more time with Chairman Kim other than perhaps President Moon working on this incredibly important challenge that lays before the world. President Trump and the world have set the conditions for a successful outcome from June 12th and the activities that are necessary to follow there from. You asked about my conversations with Chairman Kim. This question is sort of undignified, “Is he rational?” Yes, we had good conversations, substantive conversations, conversations that involve deep, complex problems, challenges the strategic decision that Chairman Kim has before him about how it is he wishes to proceed and if he is prepared in exchange for the assurances that we’re ready to provide to him if he is prepared to fully denuclearize. And I’m not sure how to define it fully.


	It’s pretty clear what that means. It would be an activity that undertook to ensure that we didn’t end up in the same place that we’d ended up before, or multiple passes at trying to solve this conundrum for the world, how to ensure that North Korea doesn’t possess the capacity to threaten not only the United States but the world with nuclear weapons. And so in order to achieve that, it will require a robust verification program and one that we will undertake with partners around the world, which will achieve that outcome in a way that frankly no agreement before it has ever set forth. A big undertaking for sure, but one that Chairman Kim and I had the opportunity to have a good, sound discussion on so that I think we have a pretty good understanding between our two countries about what the shared objectives are.


QUESTION: What’s he like?


SECRETARY POMPEO: I’m sorry.


QUESTION: What’s he like?


SECRETARY POMPEO: We had good conversations. There – it was – there’s some videos that have been released. You can see our conversations were warm. We were each representing our two countries, trying our best to make sure that we were communicating clearly, that we had a shared understanding about what our mutual objectives were. But we had good conversations about the histories of our two nations, the challenges that we’ve had between us. We talked about the fact that America has often in history had adversaries who we are now close partners with, and our hope that we could achieve the same with respect to North Korea.


MS NAUERT: All right. Thank you, Rich. Our next question goes to Yonhap News Agency.


FOREIGN MINISTER KANG: Could I just --


MS NAUERT: Oh, pardon me.


FOREIGN MINISTER KANG: -- answer that --


MS NAUERT: Yes.


FOREIGN MINISTER KANG: I think your question about sanctions relief, I think we were very clear that the sanctions remain in place until and unless we see visible, meaningful action taken by North Korea on the denuclearization track. The North Korean leader has committed to denuclearization, and formally so through the Panmunjom Declaration. We very much hope to see further steps, more concrete steps towards denuclearization being produced at the U.S.-North Korea summit. So we’re not talking about sanctions relief at this point.


	Your question about what are we looking in terms of for our own security, we are confident of our security through the Korea-U.S. joint security stance, which is why we say the issue of the alliance – any issue of the alliance, including the troop presence in our country, is a matter for our two allies to discuss and not to be put on the table with North Korea.


MS NAUERT: Okay. And our next question goes to Yonhap, to Mr. Lee Seungwoo.


QUESTION: Hello, Secretaries.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Hi.


QUESTION: So I have two questions for each of you. So --


MS NAUERT: We only have time for one, please. Thank you.


QUESTION: Oh, yeah. One for --


MS NAUERT: Yes, one.


QUESTION: Okay. So one for our Minister Kang. Can I say in Korean?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Sure.


FOREIGN MINISTER KANG: Sure.


QUESTION: (Via interpreter) Recently, there was a talk that possibly USFK can be reduced. Was it discussed in your bilateral talks today? And when President Moon visits Washington D.C. before the Pyongyang and Washington, D.C. talks, what kind of coordination did you make in the run-up to this upcoming discussion between Pyongyang and Washington, D.C.?


	(In English) (Inaudible) Pyonyang and (inaudible) Kim Jong-un, and our historic summit between President Trump and Kim is fully set up. However, the key issue is dismantling North Korea’s WMD. And I guess there’s a quite a big gap between U.S. and north standpoint. So did you actually discuss the issue with Kim, with – this issue with Kim? And have you two narrowed the differences? And do you think he’s willing to give up his WMD? Thank you.


FOREIGN MINISTER KANG: (Via interpreter) So there was no talk about reducing USFK at all. If there was any talk about USFK, it was only about how solid our alliance is, and any issue, any discussion about USFK or alliance should be discussed as such, between our two nations which are in alliance, and not in North Korea and U.S. talks, which was confirmed by Secretary Pompeo. And May 22nd is the day when U.S. President, the South Korean president will meet again. And along the way, President Trump and President Moon have a close relationship and trust with each other, and it played a key role. So in the run-up to the North Korea and the U.S. summit, discussion between the two leaders will play a key role in preparing and setting the tone for the talks. So we are making our best effort to best prepare for this summit.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Your question was about were details discussed. We had quite a conversation about it. I’m not going to share that here; we’re not going to negotiate the details of the agreement in this setting. We’ll do it in conversations between our leaders and our working teams that are hard at preparing for the summit. I am confident that we have a shared understanding of the outcome that the leaders want – certainly Presidents Trump and – President Trump and Chairman Kim, but I think President Moon as well. I think we have a shared vision for what we hope, when this process is completed, the Korean Peninsula looks like. I think we have a good understanding, and I think there is complete agreement about what the ultimate objectives are.


	We began to work through the modalities, how we would achieve that, but I’ll leave conversations about that to another time. So thank you for your question.


MS NAUERT: Thank you, everyone. Have a great afternoon.

SECRETARY POMPEO: So we had a good day in the sense that I had a good and lengthy conversation with Chairman Kim in preparation for the President’s summit. The – we are locked in on the date. We are locked in on the time. We – we’re not quite ready to announce either of those just yet, but in relatively short order – we hope in the next handful of days – we’ll be able to announce the location and the date and time. But now that part is behind us for sure, and we had a chance to talk substantively about what we intend to be on the agenda, and also how we’re going to begin to coordinate in the days ahead between now and the summit in a way that we – both sides are confident that we will set the conditions for a successful meeting between the two leaders.


	We have the three Americans on the plane, which is incredibly exciting. They seem to be in good health. The doctors are with them now, but all indications are at this point that their health is as good as could be given that they’ve been held. They all walked up the stairs themselves, with their own power, so good enough to do that. And we’ll have a – hopefully in the next couple of hours a more complete readout of their complete conditions.


QUESTION: Will they still be – will they stay or go back to Washington with you?


SECRETARY POMPEO: So they’re going to – they’re going to fly back with us. There’s another plane that will meet us there in Japan and they will – there’ll be even more robust medical capabilities on that airplane in the event that they should need it. It doesn’t look like they will, but we’re prepared to do that. So they might stay on this plane and we might shift them to another plane, but in either event they’re coming back to Washington with us.


QUESTION: Were there any glitches or anything along the way that made you seriously think this might fall apart?


SECRETARY POMPEO: It was a long day. It was a long day. But there were no moments where I felt like we were going to be anything but successful in the day. So no, no glitches, but we were on the – what, 13 hours maybe on the ground, something like that from start to finish? So a long day. A long day for the – for our counterparts, the North Korean team, as well. But worth the time and effort, and I think very productive.


QUESTION: When you said that the – that you’re locked in on the date and you’re locked in on the time, (inaudible).


SECRETARY POMPEO: The location as well. I’m sorry, we – the venue is also locked in. So yes, so date, time/venue all locked in.


QUESTION: What about how long it will last? That was something you said but I’m unclear.


SECRETARY POMPEO: So yes, so we’re planning on it will be a single day, but in the event that there is more to discuss, there’ll be an opportunity for it to extend into the second day as well.


QUESTION: And this is pretty much paved – does this prisoner release pave the way for that? Would you have gone ahead with that?


SECRETARY POMPEO: I’m sorry?


QUESTION: Would you have gone ahead with the summit if they were still holding these three men?


SECRETARY POMPEO: I don’t know the answer to that. It would have been more difficult, and it certainly would have been a more difficult situation with which we were presented. I’m glad that we don’t have to confront that.


QUESTION: Same day, there’s an announcement about Iran. There are five or six Americans who are imprisoned there.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Yes.


QUESTION: People might say you’re leaving some Americans behind while you’re picking others.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Well, we’re doing our best to get them all back. There are Americans being held in several places, right. There are Americans detained in Syria as well. I – when I was the CIA director, I could see the State Department and all of the United States Government was focused on getting every one of those Americans returned wherever they were.


QUESTION: Can you say what you think in terms – pushed Kim towards making this decision on the Americans?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Yeah, I don’t know. I think – I think that Chairman Kim is trying to set good conditions for the summit, right. I think we’re – I think we are having good conversations, productive conversations. And so I think the work that President Trump has done to put us in this place made this possible.


QUESTION: And you don’t want to tell us what the venue for the summit is? You don’t want to tell us what the venue for the summit is?


SECRETARY POMPEO: I can’t.


QUESTION: Do you think that will be a joint announcement?


SECRETARY POMPEO: That’s the --


QUESTION: When you say a handful of days --


SECRETARY POMPEO: What’s that?


QUESTION: When you said a handful of days, like, the weekend?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Yeah, we’re hoping today – what’s today now, Wednesday now? We’re hoping the beginning of next week.


MS NAUERT: Yeah, yeah.


QUESTION: So just to jump ahead --


STAFF: He’s actually getting an update from her on something --


SECRETARY POMPEO: Okay.


QUESTION: Jumping briefly back to the prisoners, can you tell us what your first words --


SECRETARY POMPEO: I’m sorry, I’m having trouble hearing you.


QUESTION: Jumping back to the prisoners, can you tell us what your first words were to them, and not hit your head on the ceiling?


SECRETARY POMPEO: I’ll do my best to do both. I welcomed them back. Although we’re not quite back home yet, I welcomed them back. They were happy to be with us on this plane, to be sure.


MS NAUERT: Can I tell them what he said? Can I tell them what they said to us?


SECRETARY POMPEO: I don’t know if that’s appropriate or not. Probably not.


QUESTION: What they said to you?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Yeah, I --


QUESTION: Well, we’d love to know. (Inaudible) never been to the (inaudible).


SECRETARY POMPEO: Well, I’ll see if – I just want to respect their privacy. I’m happy to talk about things I said, but --


QUESTION: Okay. If they want to come back and talk to us, we’d be happy to.


SECRETARY POMPEO: I’ll bet – probably for another day.


QUESTION: And was there a moment when you gave yourself a little pat on the back or --


SECRETARY POMPEO: Still have work to do. I’m thrilled that we have them back. I’m happy that actually President Trump set the conditions for this to happen, and I’m thrilled with that. But there’s still a lot of work to do to achieve our ultimate goal.


	The only other thing I should mention is I did speak with the President. I informed the President of this, and the President is planning to come out and meet the aircraft when we land.


QUESTION: In Andrews?

QUESTION: Well, that’s a big --


SECRETARY POMPEO: Whenever we get there, he is planning to come out.


QUESTION: That’s not been announced by the White House?


MS NAUERT: Sorry?


QUESTION: That?


MS NAUERT: Yeah.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Has it been announced? I haven’t seen that.


MS NAUERT: Well, not the Andrews part. Well, not the Andrews part.


QUESTION: Sure.


SECRETARY POMPEO: I don’t know if they’ve announced it. They may have. He’s pretty quick on the communications. I --


QUESTION: Have we crossed over into – we crossed over into airspace out of --


SECRETARY POMPEO: Yes.


QUESTION: Do you know what time we crossed over?


MS NAUERT: I’ll get that time for you.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Yeah.


MS NAUERT: Okay.


SECRETARY POMPEO: All right.


MS NAUERT: Thanks, guys.


QUESTION: Real quickly, did they mark that moment? Did you come back and say, “That’s it, guys, we’re out of North Korean airspace”? Did you mark it?


SECRETARY POMPEO: We were all thrilled when we knew we were outside of that space. Yes, ma’am.


	All right. Thank you all.

	As we exit the Iran deal, we will be working with our allies to find a real, comprehensive, and lasting solution to the Iranian threat. We have a shared interest with our allies in Europe and around the world to prevent Iran from ever developing a nuclear weapon. But our effort is broader than just the nuclear threat and we will be working together with partners to eliminate the threat of Iran’s ballistic missile program; to stop its terrorist activities worldwide; and to block its menacing activity across the Middle East and beyond. As we build this global effort, sanctions will go into full effect and will remind the Iranian regime of the diplomatic and economic isolation that results from its reckless and malign activity.

"May 8, 2018","
SECRETARY POMPEO:  So the first time it was truly an intel effort, in that the South Koreans had made representations about things that North Korea was preparing to do that Kim Jong-un had told them, and we largely went there to validate that those were true so that it would make sense to begin to put in place the conditions for the President’s visit. So that was the primary mission. We achieved that. He gave us a little bit of color on that but not much more. So we set some of the basic outlines, some of the ground rules, and then we began the discussion as well on the administrative elements of it – what would it look like, how long would it last, where would it be, what time frame would make sense. So that was it. It was a limited diplomatic discussion. It was truly aimed at learning and listening, making sure we understood the outlines of what was at least possible.


	Today what we’re hoping to do is – there have been discussions between that day to now, and we’ve continued to develop both administratively and sort of begin to put some outlines around the substance of the agenda for the summit between the President and Chairman Un. And today we’re hoping to nail some of those down to say – to put in place a framework for a successful summit between the two presidents.


	There’s a second piece, which is we also want to make sure that we’re square about what it isn’t, what our expectations are not. And we are not going to head back down the path that we headed down before. We’re not going to relieve sanctions until such time as we achieved our objectives. We are not going to do this in small increments, where the world is essentially coerced into relieving economic pressure. That won’t lead to the outcome that I know Kim Jong-un wants and I know President Trump is demanding, so we’re hoping to set out that set of conditions that will give them this opportunity to have a historic, big change in the security relationship between North Korea and the United States, which will achieve what the President has tweeted about and talked about: complete, verifiable, irreversible denuclearization.


	That’s the mission set. We’re trying to set out the conditions for that today. And this will be a part of that process. This will go on tomorrow. But we think it’s important. We think there’s enough that’s been discussed that it’s important for me to sit with senior North Korean leaders and try and make a big move towards making sure we’re prepared for the summit.


QUESTION: So are you expecting that you will be able to have a time, when – all that kind of stuff? I was just asking prior, before, so it’s --


SECRETARY POMPEO: It’s certainly my objective to do so.


QUESTION: Right. But the President says it’s been set, but then they said it hadn’t been set. So I mean, what, are you 99 percent certain about --


SECRETARY POMPEO: We think we have it figured out. We want to – we’d love to be able to walk away from here prepared to say yep, we now have the senior level, most senior leaders’ commitment to this date and this location. I – we’re going to work towards that.


QUESTION: Well, you don’t have that? Does that – what you’re saying is that you don’t have it yet?


SECRETARY POMPEO: It’s all – it’s --


QUESTION: You’re not –


SECRETARY POMPEO: I know the nuance is difficult.


QUESTION: Well, yeah, yeah.


SECRETARY POMPEO: We think we’re getting really close to having all the parties agreeing to – it’s not just even – a date and time is important --


QUESTION: Yeah.


SECRETARY POMPEO: And the location is important. But there are many conditions that play into that. How long is it going to go on? When you say where, like really where? Not just a city or a country, but like really where. So we’re trying to put some more meat on that – on the answer to that.


QUESTION: All right.


QUESTION: Will you be meeting with Kim Jong-un himself, do you expect?


SECRETARY POMPEO: I don’t know. We’re going to meet with the most senior leaders. The last time I traveled I did. We’re prepared to meet with anyone who is speaking on behalf of the North Korean Government and can give us solid answers so we’re prepared.


QUESTION: How important is it that – would it be for them to release the prisoners?


SECRETARY POMPEO: You know --


QUESTION: How significant is --


SECRETARY POMPEO: We have been asking for the release of these detainees for – this administration for 17 months. We’ll talk about it again today. I think it’d be a great gesture if they would choose to do so.


MS NAUERT: All right. Last question.


QUESTION: Can you have a summit if you – if they’re still holding three Americans?


SECRETARY POMPEO: We’re hopeful we don’t have to cross that road.


MS NAUERT: All right. The Secretary has to go.


QUESTION: Do you expect to bring them out?


SECRETARY POMPEO: We’re going to talk. We’re going to talk to them about it again and ask them if they would do the right thing.


MS NAUERT: Okay. Thanks, guys.


QUESTION: Thank you.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Thank you.


MS NAUERT: Thank you, sir.

SECRETARY POMPEO: Good afternoon. Today it is my pleasure and a great honor to welcome the Mexican Foreign Secretary Luis Videgaray to the State Department. Welcome.


	We had a great discussion and we had so because Mexico is one of the United States’ closest partners. Together we are working to build a more secure, prosperous, and democratic hemisphere. We are neighbors, allies, and friends.


	The conversation, as I said, was forthright. We talked about a range of issues. In particular, we spoke of four vital areas in which we work with Mexico every day: trade; management of our shared border; security; and the shared regional and global priorities of our two countries.


	First, it comes as a surprise to no one that our economic interests are deeply intertwined. Mexico is our second largest export market, third largest trading partner. The importance of modernizing NAFTA cannot be overstated, and we will continue to work towards an agreement with Mexico and with Canada.


	Second, we manage a couple-thousand-mile border. Every day more than $1.7 billion in trade crosses that border back and forth, supporting thousands of jobs on both sides of that border. We seek to improve efficiency at our ports of entry to support the legitimate flow of commerce between our two countries.


	Third, we work together to enhance our shared security by disrupting transnational criminal organizations. We recognize the demand of – for drugs is principally on the American side of the border, and that this problem is destroying communities and tearing families apart. That is why the President has renewed efforts to prevent and treat addiction here at home and to combat the flow of drugs coming into our country from abroad.


	Our security is linked to one another’s. It will take our shared resources and commitment to disrupt criminal groups that illegally traffic drugs, weapons, and human beings. Continued cooperation under the Merida Initiative advances our mutual security objectives. We’ve made some progress through the U.S.-Mexico Strategic Dialogue to disrupt these transnational criminal organizations. We should be proud of that. This will continue to be a priority for the administration.


	Fourth, and finally, we work together with Mexico on regional and global challenges. For example, we are working with our partners in Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador to reduce insecurity and violence, enhance economic opportunity, and fight corruption. These shared efforts address the underlying conditions driving illegal immigration. We also cooperate with Mexico to build regional consensus on the crisis in Venezuela. Thank you for your leadership, Secretary, on this issue in particular. I echo the message of Vice President Pence from earlier today at the OAS meeting: We urge our entire hemisphere to impose strict accountability on the corrupt and brutal Maduro regime.


	We are always looking for new ways to deepen our partnership with Mexico. Today, good news: the signing of the U.S.-Mexico Civil Nuclear Cooperation Agreement further expands our relationship and will benefit the North American and U.S. suppliers in the nuclear energy industry.


	Again, Foreign Secretary, I want to thank you for coming here today to discuss the many pressing issues facing our two countries. I’m deeply appreciative of having my first press conference here at the State Department with you. Thank you, Foreign Minister.


FOREIGN SECRETARY VIDEGARAY: Thank you very much, Secretary. Although I’ll be speaking in Spanish in a moment, I just want to say that I am very, very proud and very honored to have this first conversation with you as Secretary of State, because we’ve met before, but not in your role as Secretary of State, so I am very, very, very honored. And we had, as you said, a very productive, very frank first conversation as such. Let me switch to Spanish.


	(Via interpreter) Since the beginning of the administration of President Trump, the Mexican Government, the government of President Pena Nieto, has promoted and offered an institutional relationship of mutual benefit and mutual respect. We acknowledge that we share threats, that we have opportunities that we can take advantage of together; and we also need to say we also have some differences, some of which are public and well known, but we cannot allow those differences to define this relationship. We need to be able to work for the interest of two neighboring countries and two neighboring peoples who are brothers so as to overcome our differences. Mexico, Mr. Secretary Pompeo, is a large country, a proud country, proud of its history, enthused about its future, and we are a sovereign state. And as a sovereign state, we offer the United States our friendship, the will to work together on the issues that join us to do good things – good things for the people of the United States and of course for the people of Mexico.


	The relationship between Mexico and the United States finds itself at a turning point of the decisions made between our governments in the next few months, even in the next few days. Well, this will determine the relationship between our two countries for the next years and even the next few decades. We find ourselves at that crucial moment in the renegotiation and modernization of NAFTA, a renegotiation that Mexico faces in good faith with constructive spirit, convinced that North America can be the most competitive region in the world, and with the belief that we have huge, concrete opportunities for prosperity and well-paid jobs for all of our inhabitants.


	We have shared challenges on the issue of security, and moments ago Secretary Pompeo was mentioning the work we’ve done throughout a new high-level group to fight transnational criminal organizations. We will continue along that path. This is what we have agreed upon on the understanding that the problem does not have to do with supply or demand; the problem is a market at the regional level that needs to be disarticulated so as to be able to fight successfully this phenomenon.


	With regards to migration, we face common challenges. Mexico has stopped become – being simply an origin country; we are also becoming a country that receives migrants. We need to continue to think about priority to the fundamental dignity of migrants, whatever their migratory condition. Of course, we will continue to work on the regional issues where we share values and a vision. This is the case with regards to Central America. In particular with the countries of the so-called Northern Triangle – Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras – we will continue to promote development and security. We have agreed upon the fact that in the next few weeks we will have in the city of Washington the second conference that puts together Mexico and the United States as cohosts with the three governments of Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador, and other regional partners that will continue to be part of this effort.


	With regards to Venezuela, we share to a very large extent the concern given the situation of systematic disruption of democracy. We will continue to call for a solution arising from Venezuelans themselves who can find a peaceful solution to re-establish democracy in their country. Of course, we will continue to work on different causes at multilateral organizations where we share values and purposes.


	I’d like to take advantage of this opportunity to underscore the fact that the Government of Mexico is very pleased with the progress made to achieve the denuclearization of the North Korean Peninsula. We recognize the work of Secretary Pompeo in this regards. This is an issue that affects us all around the world.


	Finally, I’d like to thank the Department of State, the Department of Energy, and the entirety of the Trump administration who was part of this for the signature of the Cooperation Agreement for the Peaceful Use of Nuclear Energy. This agreement, which will be presented throughout a newsletter in the next few minutes, will allow us to continue strengthening cooperation, specifically in the area of technological transfers so that Mexico can continue to develop its nuclear energy so that the next governments in Mexico can continue to develop the use of nuclear technology for medical purposes, for example, or for the generation of electricity if that is decided in the future.


	Thank you, Secretary, for the signature of this agreement which I believe it is important to highlight; beyond everything we see on the media and the differences we might have, this shows we continue to work together, we continue to address specific issues that are useful for our peoples and creating a better future for our region. I wish you the greatest of success. It is an honor for me to be back at the Department of State and to be here with you at your first message to the media in this hall. Thank you, Secretary Pompeo. We are ready to continue working together.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Thank you very much. This is wonderful. Thank you so much.

AMBASSADOR STEPHENSON: Good afternoon, and welcome. Please be seated, oh, if you can. I’m Barbara Stephenson, president of the American Foreign Service Association. Thank you for joining us here today as we gather to pay tribute to our colleagues who lost their lives while serving our country overseas. It has been over 80 years since these plaques were unveiled by then Secretary of State Henry Stimson. More recently, the Senate in 1996 passed a resolution calling for the first Friday of May to be recognized as American Foreign Service Day. That resolution had 54 cosponsors from both parties, showing broad bipartisan support for the idea of strong American global leadership, and for the Foreign Service.


	I want to thank Secretary of State Mike Pompeo for being with us today. And also thank Under – yes. (Applause.) And we also want to thank Under Secretary of State Tom Shannon for being with us today. (Applause.) Their presence speaks volumes about the importance that we in this community place on remembering and honoring those among us who do not make it home. Last year, we had the good fortune of not having to add a name to the plaques. Sadly, that is not the case this year. Andy Jordan and Selena Nelson-Salcedo were valued members of our community, doing the work they loved on behalf of our country. This year, we honor them by adding their names to AFSA’s memorial plaques. Andy and Selena’s families, friends and colleagues are here today in large numbers. Thank you all for being with us today.


	We in the Foreign Service pledge to do our best to manage the risks that are inherent in our mission. We also confirm by our presence today that members of the Foreign Service who die while serving our country abroad will be remembered and honored for their service and sacrifice. The presence of so many distinguished colleagues and guests demonstrates that commitment.


	I want to welcome, in particular, USAID Administrator Mark Green; Foreign Agricultural Service Administrator Ken Isley; APHIS Associate Administrator Dr. Michael Watson; Broadcasting Board of Governors Chief of Staff Matt Walsh; USAID Counselor Tom Staal; Under Secretary Andrea Thompson; Assistant Secretaries of State Dan Smith, Manisha Singh and Carl Risch; Deputy Under Secretary for Management Bill Todd; Acting Assistant Secretaries Francisco Palmieri, Don Yamamoto, Judith Garber, Susan Thornton, James Walsh, Alice Wells, and Mike Kozak; deputy chief of mission at the embassy of the Slovak Republic Jozef Polakovic; Adam Sterling, U.S. ambassador to the Slovak Republic; other members of the department’s leadership, Doctor Mark Cohen, Will Moser, Karen Mummaw, Molly Phee, Anita Friedt, and Christian Sherman, and Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield.


	As you know, more than two thirds of the Foreign Service is stationed abroad at any given moment. For the second year, we have invited those colleagues to join our commemoration today, by participating in moments of silence at posts around the world at noon local time. Members of the Foreign Service joined us in observing a moment of silence in honor of our fallen colleagues in embassies and consulates in Abu Dhabi, Accra, Amman, Ankara, Athens, Baghdad, Bratislava, Cairo, Canberra, Caracas, Conakry, Dakar, Dili, Doha, Dublin, Geneva, Georgetown, The Hague, Harare, Kabul, Kolkata, Kuala Lumpur, Lima, Lisbon, Ljubljana, N’Djamena, New Delhi, Ouagadougou, Panama City, Port of Spain, Praia, Rangoon, Reykjavik, Singapore, Tbilisi, Vilnius, Warsaw, and many others.


	This moment of silence that we observe each year is never easy. Our losses are real and we feel them deeply. The pride we feel in our mission is also real. We know that for America to lead, we must be present. I’m confident that those we honor today would want us to remain steadfast, be present, and keep the American flag flying at posts around the world. Before we offer our own moment of silence, I would like to ask everyone to please stand as the United States Armed Forces Color Guard present the colors.


	(The Colors were presented.)


	I ask that you remain standing for a moment of silence in honor of our fallen colleagues, and then for the National Anthem. Fellow Foreign Service officer Katie Nutt will bring us out of the moment of silence by singing the Star Spangled Banner. Katie asks that we all join her in singing the final phrase, on the back of your programs, beginning, “Oh say, does that star-spangled banner yet wave.”


	Now please join me and our colleagues at embassies and consulates around the globe in observing a Moment of Silence in honor of our fallen colleagues.


	(A Moment of Silence was observed.)


	(The National Anthem was sung.)


AMBASSADOR STEPHENSON: Thank you, Katie. Please, be seated. Our anthem asks, “Oh say, does that star-spangled banner yet wave?” The answer to that question is and must remain, “Yes.” The answer to that question – as the photos from the moments of silence held at embassies and consulates around the globe show, the Star-Spangled Banner continues to wave proudly – a visible demonstration of America’s global leadership. I invite you to join me in committing to ensuring we can say the same thing next year and a decade from now and 20 years from now.


	I would now like to invite our Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to the podium. (Applause.)


SECRETARY POMPEO: Thank you so much, Ambassador Stephenson, for hosting this important service. I am grateful to see so many leaders here, as the ambassador mentioned, from throughout the department and indeed leaders throughout our government.


	Thank you for joining us as we pay tribute to our colleagues, our friends, our family members, who have died in service to our nation.


	This wall to my rear stands as a reminder that sacrifice is part of our department’s culture. It’s part of our DNA. The 248 names behind me represent lives lived – not for their own glory or their own good – but for the good of others, for promoting peace and prosperity in selfless service to their fellow Americans.


	I’m reminded of a verse from Scripture. The book of Philippians commands us: Let each of us – you look not only to his own interests, but also to the interests of others. Those on this wall have done that in the ultimate form. They abandoned their own comfort and security for the sake of our countrymen. They paid the price for freedom we enjoy today. And we are all indebted to them.


	Today we want to honor in particular the individuals whose names we are adding to this wall of heroes.


	Michael Andrew Cameron Jordan, known to his friends and family as Andy. He served the American people all over the world, most recently in Juba, South Sudan.


	The second name is Selena Nelson-Salcedo, who most recently served as consular chief at the U.S. Embassy in Bratislava, Slovakia.


	Selena and Andy worked hard on behalf of all of us. They were patriotic and passionate about advancing the United States’s interests abroad. They leave behind families, friends, and coworkers who will miss them greatly. But they also leave behind a great legacy of selfless service that will be a reminder to us all and to future generations forever. The names on this wall illustrate that we are living in uncertain, difficult times. Every morning, I’m grateful to be working with colleagues who are up to the challenge, willing to sacrifice so much, whether Foreign or Civil Service or locally employed staff, every day in support of our mission.


	I promise I’m going to do everything I can to keep every single one of our team members safe. One of the things I did as the director of the CIA and will continue to do as Secretary is to visit posts abroad and see how our family members are living and working. I always stop and ask the question: Would I be comfortable placing my own family in this situation? That’s the standard for evaluating how well we are doing for our people and how well we are doing in keeping them and their families safe. If the conditions aren’t good enough for the Pompeo family, we will fix it. If the safety is inadequate, we will correct it. If there are shortcomings in security measures, we will get after them immediately. It’s my job. The very first briefing I received after I was nominated was on the issue of security. I take this mission incredibly seriously.


	So today, as we remember the fallen during this solemn occasion, we grieve for these heroes. We pray for their families and their friends and colleagues. But we must also keep our eyes fixed, knowing that a more stable and peaceful future is ahead because of the legacy they have helped us achieve. Every day, we get up with a goal in mind, remembering that the sacrifice we all make makes freedom possible, and we channel their dedication and their commitment to propel us forward. Thank you all. (Applause.)


AMBASSADOR STEPHENSON: Thank you, Mr. Secretary. I know I speak for all of us when I say how much we appreciate that you are with us today. I’d now like to ask Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs Tom Shannon to come to the podium.


UNDER SECRETARY SHANNON: Thank you, Barbara. Thank you, Mr. Secretary. I’m deeply honored to be here on this most meaningful of occasions. These plaques and those across our lobby chart the measure of devotion and sacrifice of American Foreign Service officers and civil servants across nearly 240 years. They hold the names and memories, as the Secretary noted, of 248 heroic Americans, but after today it will be 250, who have died while in the service of our great republic. Of these, 112 have been added since the day I raised my hand and swore to support and defend the Constitution of the United States in 1984. Each of these names, from William Palfrey, the very first in 1780, to those we will add today, has a compelling story. Each had a family and friends and colleagues who mourn their death.


	This year, we mourn and honor two more members of our Foreign Service family. I want to share with you the stories of Michael Andrew Cameron Jordan and Selena Nelson-Salcedo, two outstanding examples of the very best of the Foreign Service. Michael Andrew Cameron Jordan, known to his family and friends as Andy, served as the information management officer at U.S. Mission in Juba, South Sudan. He died unexpectedly on December 18th, 2016. Andy joined the Foreign Service in 2003 and served with distinction in Baghdad, Brussels, Karachi, Tel Aviv, Lusaka, Tbilisi, and Nairobi.


	Andy’s humble nature meant he never boasted of his contributions or their impact, but they were significant. While in South Sudan, a country with an eroding infrastructure and a deteriorating security situation, Andy, through his ingenuity and talent, maintained an IT platform that enabled the embassy team to carry out its mission of feeding 2 million people per month and providing water and sanitation to 2,500 – 250,000 people living in UN camps, and much more. Andy would take no credit for himself for these accomplishments; rather, he would shower praise on his team. He was especially supportive of and beloved by the embassy’s Foreign Service Nationals. He exhibited these traits of professional excellence and personal generosity in all of his assignments.


	Andy’s pride and joy was his family – his wife, Deb, and his two beautiful daughters, Madi and Helena. They are all here today. Andy loved his family dearly. He often wore t-shirts from Helena’s regattas and would decorate his workspace with Madi’s art. To Deb, to Madi, to Helena, you do us great honor through your presence here today, and you do us a great kindness by allowing us to share with you our grief at the loss of Andy. Our words can provide little comfort, but we hope our solidarity and respect can ease the ache and provide some solace.


	Today we also honor Selena Nelson-Salcedo. Selena was the consular chief at the U.S. Embassy in Bratislava when she passed away on June 4th, 2017. Selena joined the department as a Foreign Service officer in 2008, after a brilliant academic career in her native Midwest. She earned an undergraduate degree from the University of Wisconsin at Madison, and a master’s degree from the Humphrey School of Public Affairs at the University of Minnesota. During her time in the State Department, she served in the Dominican Republic, Malaysia, and Slovakia. She spoke five languages fluently. She was passionate about civil rights and social justice, and spent much of her career working to improve the lives of the poor and disenfranchised around the world. She was a great soul.


	Selena is survived by her husband Jorge, who is a valued member of our department. She also leaves her wonderful daughters Gaia, who will turn four years old tomorrow, and Antonella. Jorge, Gaia, and Antonella are joined here today by over a dozen members of their extended family. Thank you for being with us today. Your courage and your generosity of spirit has provided us with great comfort. The thoughts and gratitude of every member of the Foreign Service family are with you today.


	The Greek poet and dramatist Aeschylus wrote, “In our sleep, pain which cannot forget falls drop by drop upon the heart until, in our despair, against our will, comes wisdom through the awful grace of God.” That pain has etched the names of Andy and Selena into our hearts. It has also etched their names into stone, where they will serve both as an inspiration and an example of lives lived courageously in the service of the American people.


	Mr. Secretary, Madam Ambassador, could you please unveil the names.


	(The names were unveiled.)


	Michael Andrew Cameron Jordan, Selena Nelson-Salcedo, we salute you. May God bless you. Yes, call forth the wreath, please.


AMBASSADOR STEPHENSON: Thank you, Tom, for being here, and thank you for your exemplary service to our nation. Will you all please stand as the United States Armed Forces Color Guard retires the colors.


	(The Colors were retired.)


AMBASSADOR STEPHENSON: I would like to conclude today’s ceremony by thanking you all for being here today and for honoring our colleagues and the Foreign Service community. Thank you all.

UNDER SECRETARY SHANNON: Ladies and gentlemen, welcome and good afternoon. It’s a tremendous pleasure to see you all again. You’ve had a busy day, and I hope your discussions have been fruitful and have allowed you to engage on the many challenges and opportunities that face American diplomacy. Now you have an opportunity to meet and hear from our new Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo.


	Secretary Pompeo is a great public servant, having served as an Army officer, a member of the House of Representatives, and until recently as director of the Central Intelligence Agency. He is a man of deep intellect, broad understanding of global issues, and strong character. He wasted no time getting started as Secretary of State, traveling directly from his confirmation and swearing-in to Brussels for the NATO ministerial, and then on to Saudi Arabia, Israel, and Jordan. He has returned in time for Foreign Affairs Day. (Laughter and applause.) And to meet with all of you.


	So ladies and gentlemen, please join me in welcoming the 70th Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo. (Applause.)


SECRETARY POMPEO: Thank you. Thank you all very much. While I was standing there, I did the math. I count about 12,000 years of experience in the room. (Laughter.)


	And I must say, it’s an honor to be with you here today. It’s the 53rd Foreign Affairs Day. I know I speak for everyone in the building when I say that we’re grateful for your service to the country and the many sacrifices you and your families have made along the way.


	President Eisenhower – I tend to use Kansas quotes – he’s a Kansan I greatly admire – he once remarked that when State Department colleagues get together, it felt more like a “family gathering” than anything else. I have already found that description fits. I was given an incredibly warm welcome on my first day. The team has been great. My wife joked that she hoped that I wasn’t peaking that day. (Laughter.) Always that risk. And it’s still the case. As I was walking down the hall, I realized I still need help to find my way around the building.


	I want to thank a few people for making today possible. Our generous co-sponsors, the American Foreign Service Association, DACOR, and the Senior Living Foundation of the American Foreign Service. Thank you for making this possible, and for your constant support of our team. (Applause.)


	I also want to thank – congratulate, rather, some very special people. I want to congratulate the award recipients: DACOR’s Foreign Service Cup winner Ambassador Henry Allen Holmes. (Applause.) Thank you, Ambassador, for serving our community both in and out of government, and to dedicating your life to equipping the next generation of our team’s leaders. We are also proud today to recognize the winners of the Director General’s Civil Service Cup and Foreign Service Cup – Richard Greene and Ambassador Kristie Kenney. (Applause.)


	You have all had a long day, but this day does offer a real opportunity, an opportunity to review – to consider our successes from the past in a building of strong – and in how we’ve built a strong, diverse corps of the best foreign affairs professionals in the world. But it also provides an opportunity to consider the future, and in my first week on the job it’s mostly future, not past. There are many challenges we face today; you all know that. And while I’m new to this, and it is my first week, I want to talk to you about where I believe we’re going, and my commitment to you and our Foreign and Civil Service team.


	But for starters, the good news is while I have not been here long, I already know the mettle, patriotism, and the nature and character and the dedication of you and your colleagues. I remember trips I took as a member of Congress where I watched Foreign Service officers putting their lives on hold at all hours of the day and night, working weekends to help us get the most out of our visit. And I know they were working when we were gone, as well.


	One thing I learned right away is that the department’s heroes regularly toil outside of the limelight, in tough environments all over the world. So well before I raised my right hand and took the Oath of Office, the State Department had already served me incredibly well. And it is indeed an enormous honor to now be part of this group.


	These times are turbulent. The demands are for strong leadership. It is essential that our team does that and counters the threats that we face with courage and strength. I know that you all did that; I know that our team will do that in the days ahead.


	Fortunately, we have a President who believes in muscular diplomacy as well, one that makes full use of the instruments of national power to advance, first and foremost, vital American interests and values.


	Effective, forward-thinking diplomacy increases our chances of solving problems peacefully, without ever firing a shot.


	Our foreign policy, too, it’s got to be pragmatic while still remaining principled – and agile enough to respond to changing circumstances yet anchored in the fundamental ideals and values that ground – ground our nation’s history. I saw our country’s strength and commitment to those ideals as a young cavalry officer. Tom referred to my time in the military. I led troops that patrolled the boundary between freedom and communism along the East German – then-East German and Czechoslovakian border. Today the world strength – the world needs that strength and those ideals ever more.


	We have to continue this centuries-old mission of defending freedom, liberty, and human dignity around the world, while first keeping our country and people safe.


	At that time, I recall we were prepared for conflict along the Iron Curtain, but it was diplomacy executed over months and years and, indeed, decades that saved me and my tank platoon from ever having to engage.


	This is every corner of the world today. Men and women of the State Department and USAID out there serving America’s interests. It’s essential to deal with the many challenges. My mission is to help every member of our team achieve that goal.


	Today there are several places – you’ve heard about some of them – there’s enormous diplomatic effort to continue to keep the pressure on North Korea and bring them to the negotiating table, to a place where we can successfully eliminate the threat from Kim Jong-un’s nuclear arsenal.


	We see it, too, with our allies in Europe. I spent my first few days there – indeed, my first hours. We’re blessed to have so many allies with strong relationships. There are, of course, rough times and places that we disagree. But these countries share our values and our interests, and we all have a common effort in ensuring prosperity for our nations moving forward.


	I traveled from there to the Middle East. We need strong diplomatic efforts there as well to prevent Iran’s destabilizing behavior in Syria, in Yemen, and across the region. We have to tackle the threat form jihadist terror and from places with really weak governance. These are all great challenges, but I’m confident that our team can develop strategies and diplomatic footprints capable of resolving them.


	We often don’t talk so much about Latin America, but as we witness the destruction of a once prosperous and democratic nation in our near-abroad, we need to tackle that diplomatically as well. A dictator today in Venezuela cripples his economy and starves his people. We need a strong State Department and USAID to help the millions of Venezuelans fleeing the corrupt regime as a result of this entirely man-made crisis.


	And finally, we need our diplomats and foreign affairs professionals working all over the world to promote the dignity of every single human being to live freely and achieve their full potential.


	A lot’s changed in the 53 years since the first time this ceremony was held. But I am confident that one thing that has never faltered is the character of the people who deliver American diplomacy. The men and women of this department and the agencies represented have always been called upon to do great things. Great things that still resonate throughout these walls and throughout the history of our great country. This team responded to the Iranian revolution in 1979; and organized an important summit in Reykjavik in 1986; we built a coalition of partners during the first Gulf War; and I’ve already talked about the reunification of Germany, assisting a newly free Central and Eastern Europe in the wake of it. There’s more history to be made. I’m confident of that. And it will be because of the hardworking men and women that I have been chosen to lead.


	I want to thank everyone here today for helping write that history. This is a remarkable institution. I’ve seen a handful of our officers in this first week. I can tell you that you have prepared them well. Over the course of the weeks and months, I’d welcome thoughts from you, ideas, your expertise, and I know that together we can achieve great things for our nation.


	Today is also special because we get a chance to remember and honor the sacrifice of Americans living and working abroad on behalf of the United States.


	Following my remarks, it will be a privilege to take part in a memorial ceremony to honor those who lost their lives in service to our country. In particular, we will honor the service of one man and one woman who made the ultimate sacrifice while honorably serving America abroad. Our nation owes them and their families an enormous debt of gratitude. Let’s remember them and the great sacrifice our team makes every day to advance America’s interests and protect our nation.


	It has been a great pleasure to host the reunion my first week on the job. I cannot imagine a better start to my time in service. Thank you for your service, and please do not be strangers. Thank you and God bless you. (Applause.)

	On behalf of President Trump and the people of the United States, I congratulate the people and government of Poland as you celebrate the 227th anniversary of the Constitution of the Third of May.


	The Constitution of the Third of May was a landmark event in Poland’s history, making it among the first countries in the world to adopt a written constitution. This year is also the centennial of Poland’s recovery of its independence on November 11, 1918, as well as President Woodrow Wilson’s Fourteen Points, which included a call for the restoration of “an independent Poland.” We recall our common heritage in the events of 1918 and affirm our strong alliance today.

SECRETARY POMPEO: This is truly humbling. Thank you very much, Mr. President, for those kind words. Thank you, Mr. Vice President, for being here today to honor me by swearing me in. Thank you, Ambassador Lawler. Ambassador Glendon, thank you so much for that invocation. I used to work for her for $7.50 an hour. (Laughter.)


It is a great honor to have so many distinguished guests here, including many of my fellow – my fellow cabinet secretaries and former colleagues in Congress. Thank you for coming today. 


I was also glad to see USAID Administrator Mark Green. I look forward to working with you.


I want to first thank God for this opportunity, and for the many blessings he has granted to me in my life.


My wife Susan and my son Nick are two of the greatest of these. They are my number one fans, most days. (Laughter.)


And they have shown unyielding support to me throughout my confirmation process and at every other stage in my public service career. I love you both very, very much. (Applause.)


I want to thank John Sullivan, Deputy Secretary Sullivan. Where’s John? Yeah. John, thank you. Thank you for your service in this interim period. (Applause.)


Mr. President, I always want – also want to say thank you to you. You have entrusted me with a weighty and awesome responsibility to serve the American people – first as the director of the CIA, and now as the Secretary of State.


This responsibility becomes more sobering when we consider the many threats to American security and prosperity and our liberty.


Mr. President, I promise you my team and I will be unrelenting in confronting those threats.


We will employ tough diplomacy, when necessary, to put the interests of the American people first. I will work to ensure their safety, to preserve their rights, and to defend their values. And I will make sure America is always a respected and principled leader on the world stage. (Applause.)


We are but 15 months into this administration, and we’ve already made outstanding progress by speaking the truth about the challenges we face, by confronting them head-on, by partnering with strong, sovereign, independent nations to make America – and the world – more prosperous and secure.


We’ve put hurt on the ISIS caliphate in Iraq and Syria. We’ve done so by great diplomatic work.


We are confronting all types of Iranian hostility, and are deciding on the next steps for the flawed JCPOA.


We’ve imposed real consequences on Russia for its acts of aggression.


And we will soon move our embassy in Israel to Jerusalem years ahead of schedule. (Applause.)


We are bringing fairness and reciprocity to our economic relationship with China and protecting our intellectual property from them as well. (Applause.)


And we saw in your meetings last week with President Macron and Chancellor Merkel, we continue to uphold and strengthen our time-honored alliances.


But there’s one more thing. Right now, we have an unprecedented opportunity to change the course of history on the Korean Peninsula.


I underscore the word opportunity.


We are in the beginning stages of the work, and the outcome is certainly yet unknown. But one thing is certain: this administration will not repeat the mistakes of the past. Our eyes are wide open.


It’s time to solve this once and for all. A bad deal is not an option. The American people are counting on us to get this right.


We are committed to the permanent, verifiable, irreversible dismantling of North Korea’s weapons of mass destruction program, and to do so without delay.


To my colleagues here: When I say “we’re” going to do this, I mean “we.” This is a team effort at the State Department and the whole of the United States Government.


Mr. President, when you offered me the job to be the director of the CIA, I was honored to lead the world’s finest intelligence corps.


And I am incredibly honored and humbled by the opportunity to lead the world’s finest diplomatic corps now. (Applause.)


Mr. President, you read one of – a great quote from the greatest president ever from Kansas. (Laughter.) It was a historic quote, but frankly, things haven’t changed much since then. I’ve been an Army officer, a congressman, the director of the CIA, now here at State. 


We have much to do, but in every position I’ve had, I’ve witnessed the skills, expertise, and patriotism of our foreign affairs professionals. Whether civil servants or Foreign Service officers, political appointees, or locally employed staff, you all lay it on the line to make sure that America is safe and prosperous and free. Thank you for that. (Applause.)


As I’ve said, and I’ll elaborate more, I want the State Department to get its swagger back. We need our men and women out at the front lines, executing American diplomacy with great vigor and energy, and to represent the finest nation in the history of civilization. We should be proud of that, and I’m counting on you all to help communicate in every corner of the world. 


Mr. President, I have full confidence that my team here in Washington and around the world, under your leadership, can and will execute that mission for the benefit of the American people. And I’m eager to work with you all to get that job done.


You all know this is essential work. That’s why you’re here. It’s why I’m here. I look forward to doing this together.


Thank you all so much for the warm welcome I have received in these first days. I can’t wait to get after this with you. 


Thank you again, Mr. President, for your trust and your leadership and your faith in me.


Thank you. (Applause.)

DEPUTY SECRETARY SULLIVAN: Thank you. Thank you, everyone, for being here. It’s a great honor to be here to introduce our new Secretary of State. Before I do so, I wanted to thank all of you, each and every one of you, for your hard work over the last six weeks. The pace of world events doesn’t pause to allow the United States Government to change from one secretary of state to another, but it’s because of your dedication and professionalism that this department has continued to meet its mission for the American people. So thank you to all of you for all you’ve done the last six weeks. (Applause.)


	And now it’s my great honor to introduce our new Secretary. You all know his bio; he’s a former three-term member of Congress, former-now director of the Central Intelligence Agency. I offer my own perspective as somebody who comes from the private practice of law; in looking at his bio, I looked at it through the lens of a former law firm partner, and I imagined how I would assess his bio if I were looking at our opposing counsel, and I had to advise my client on who we were going to be dealing with. And what stood out to me was we have a tank commander who then went to Harvard Law School and was elected to the Harvard Law Review, which is a pretty unusual combination. So if I were advising my client about who we were going to be dealing with on the other side of the table if we’re in negotiation, or if it were in a court room, I’d say, “Wow. Well, ma’am, we’re dealing with a cross between George Patton and Oliver Wendell Holmes.” (Laughter.)


	So that’s a pretty tough combination to face as an opponent, but the good news for us is he’s coming here to lead our team. It’s the adversaries of the United States who are going to be facing that formidable opponent across the table.


	So without further ado, I’ll turn over the microphone to the 70th Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo. (Applause and cheers.)


SECRETARY POMPEO: Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thanks for those most gracious words, John. And thank you for your service and standing in the gap. You’ve done a remarkable job; the whole team has. I’ve had the chance to work alongside you as the CIA director when you were the acting secretary, and you have done this organization incredibly proud. America should be proud of you, and thank you for this amazing work. (Applause and cheers.)


	So I think I have the record for the longest trip to the first day of work. (Laughter.) And I am humbled to be here. I tried to prepare myself for this moment, but to stand here and look at the most important diplomatic corps in the world is enormously humbling to me. I talked in my hearing about the fact that this nation is so exceptional and so incredibly blessed. And the facts that derive from that are that it also creates a responsibility, a duty for America all across the world. And I know for certain that America can’t execute that duty, can’t achieve its objectives absent you all, absent executing America’s foreign policy in every corner of the world with incredible vigor and incredible energy. And I am looking forward to helping you all achieve that. (Applause.)


	My remarks today will be relatively brief. Tomorrow the President will be here to do my official swearing-in. I think much of the cabinet will be here as well. It’s an important day for the President’s first trip to this important place, and I’m looking forward to being there with many of you and having the honor to have the President of the United States do my formal swearing-in.


	I then will, sometime either later this week or beginning of next, do more to develop my commander’s intent, what it is I hope to achieve with your help. I’ll speak to the entire work force, I’ll lay out for you my expectations and my hopes, and most importantly, share with you my leadership style. And this is very different. Like, one of the first rules is don’t talk down to people, right? (Laughter.) So I’ll speak to you all right up here, exactly.


	But alongside that is that I feel like I know you. I’ve worked alongside you as a member of Congress when I traveled. I’ve had the chance to watch when I was traveling around the world and I would go into an embassy and I’d arrive late at night and there were the folks in the political section or the economic section toiling, doing great work on behalf of America.


	So I have a great deal to learn about the State Department and how we perform our mission, but as people, I’m confident that I know who you are. I know that you came here. You chose to be a Foreign Service officer or a civil servant or to come work here in many other capacities and to do so because you’re patriots and great Americans and because you want to be an important part of America’s face to the world. My mission will be to lead you and allow you to do that, the very thing you came here to do. (Applause.)


	I will get to as many parts of this organization as I can. I said in my testimony that I’ll spend as little time on the seventh floor – I think it’s the seventh floor, right? Yeah. (Laughter.) I’ll go up there in a minute. I’ll be – I’ll travel. I’m going to get out to USAID as quickly as I can to see their important part of our mission as well. I know that every task, every endeavor that each of you undertakes is a critical part of achieving that ultimate objective, which is to deliver President Trump and America’s foreign policy around the world, to be the diplomatic face that achieves the outcomes that America so desperately needs to achieve in the world.


	I’ve told this story a couple of times, but it’s worth repeating: The best lesson I ever got was from a fellow named Sgt. 1st Class Petry. He was the first platoon sergeant in my first tank platoon when I was 22 or 23 years old. And I arrived there and he, when I hopped out of the jeep, he said, “Lieutenant, you’ll do well to just shut up for a while.” (Laughter.) And he – and actually, I think he meant that, but – (laughter) – but what I took him to be saying was that it’s important that we listen and learn, and I know that I have an enormous amount to listen to you about and to learn from you. I talked about getting back our swagger, and I’ll fill in what I mean by that, but it’s important. The United States diplomatic corps needs to be in every corner, every stretch of the world, executing missions on behalf of this country, and it is my humble, noble undertaking to help you achieve that.


	So I look forward – (applause) – thank you. (Applause.) I look forward to meeting just as many of you as I can get a chance to do, to learning from just as many of you as I can, and to leading that team onto the field. I know that we will deliver for this President and for this country. Thank you. May the Good Lord bless each of you. I’ll see you all around the building. Thanks. (Applause.)

",Welcome Remarks to Employees,http://www.state.gov/secretary/remarks/2018/05/281365.htm
"April 30, 2018","
	For many years, the Iranian regime has insisted to the world that its nuclear program was peaceful. The documents obtained by Israel from inside of Iran show beyond any doubt that the Iranian regime was not telling the truth. I have personally reviewed many of the Iranian files. Our nonproliferation and intelligence officials have been analyzing tens of thousands of pages and translating them from Farsi. This analytical work will continue for many months. We assess that the documents we have reviewed are authentic.


	The documents show that Iran had a secret nuclear weapons program for years. Iran sought to develop nuclear weapons and missile delivery systems. Iran hid a vast atomic archive from the world and from the IAEA — until today.


	Among the flaws of the Iran nuclear deal was the whitewashing of Iran’s illicit activities related to its military nuclear program. Iran had many opportunities over the years to turn over its files to international inspectors from the IAEA and admit its nuclear weapons work. Instead, they lied to the IAEA repeatedly. They also lied about their program to the six nations who negotiated the Iran nuclear deal. What this means is the deal was not constructed on a foundation of good faith or transparency. It was built on Iran’s lies. Iran’s nuclear deception is inconsistent with Iran’s pledge in the nuclear deal “that under no circumstances will Iran ever seek, develop, or acquire any nuclear weapons.”


	We are therefore assessing what the discovery of Iran’s secret nuclear files means for the future of the JCPOA. Allowing restrictions on Iran’s nuclear program to sunset was a mistake. One has to ask: Why exactly was Iran hiding half a ton of nuclear weaponization files while implementing the Iran deal? It is worth recalling that from 2006-2015, Iran was prohibited by Security Council resolutions from enriching any nuclear material. Now that the world knows Iran has lied and is still lying, it is time to revisit the question of whether Iran can be trusted to enrich or control any nuclear material. As the President’s May 12 deadline to fix the Iran deal approaches, I will be consulting with our European allies and other nations on the best way forward in light of what we now know about Iran’s past pursuit of nuclear weapons and its systematic deception of the world.

FOREIGN MINISTER SAFADI: It is a great pleasure to welcome you here in Jordan. You are no stranger to Amman; you’ve been here many, many times before. And I think you know firsthand how strong and how solid our friendship and our partnership is. And your visiting with us so early into your assumption in your responsibilities as Secretary of State is yet another sign of how valuable that partnership and how solid that friendship is.


	I look forward to continue to working with you, sir, on building our relationship, strengthening our bilateral ties, but also strengthening our partnership, which has done a lot of good at bad times for the causes of peace, stability, and security that we pursue as common objectives. So you are here as a friend and (inaudible).


	Our partnership is one in pursuit of peace and stability, as I said. We value that, and we also value the tremendous support that the United States has continued to give Jordan throughout the years. The new MOU which we just recently signed, the first under President Trump and the largest ever to Jordan, is extremely important to our efforts to carry out our necessary economic reforms and to enable us to meet our defense (inaudible). For that again we thank you, sir.


	Our talks today offered a tremendous opportunity to go over an array of issues, many of the challenges that we face. Again, the conversation was focused on how we can continue to work together to bring about peace and stability to the region and we will continue to coordinate and cooperate as we try to resolve many of the conflicts and crises that have denied peoples of the region the peace and stability and opportunity that they deserve. Key to that, as you know, for us in Jordan is the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. This is, we believe, the main cause of instability in the region, and its resolution is the key to achieving the lasting and comprehensive peace that we want. The two-state solution remains the only path to that peace, as we believe in Jordan, and it is the solution that would allow for the emergence of an independent, sovereign Palestine state with East Jerusalem as its capital in the lines of June 4, 1967. There is a deadlock in these efforts now, and we know that the status quo cannot be maintained. We have a difficult situation but the challenge is always to make sure that this difficult situation does not get worse. We in Jordan are committed to doing everything we can in cooperation with our partner in the U.S. and others in the international community to make sure that we create political horizons and move towards achieving that solution.


	Yes, that – the two-state solution is being challenged. Yes, there are many obstacles. But I think what is – what is the alternative? We cannot give up in our efforts to achieve peace, nor can we say that there is any viable alternative that we can sustain.


	The Secretary and I are also in agreement on Syria. We need a political solution that will preserve the integrity and sovereignty of the Syrian – of Syria and a solution that will be acceptable to the Syrian people. We believe Geneva is the path to achieve that solution on the basis of 2254. The de-escalation zone in the south is an example of U.S., Jordanian, and Russian cooperation. That zone has saved a lot of lives, has prevented against further destruction, has prevented against new waves of refugees, and we in Jordan are hosts to over 1.3 million Syrians, so that is a tremendous pressure that we have. And that zone has helped mitigate all those risks. We, again, are continuing to preserve that zone and work towards a peaceful solution to Syria and that zone and that deal (inaudible) political – ultimate political solution to the Syrian crisis.


	The war on terror is a war that we fight together. Terrorists are outside our humanity; the second we do not belong to any culture, to any civilization, to any – they are outside of our humanity. As his majesty says, they are thugs, they are outlaws. We fight that war in defense of our people, in defense of our security, but also in defense of our common values and in defense of our – of the values of peace and respect that Islam embodies. So we continue to be partners and this is a war that we fought side by side, and we appreciate the U.S. leadership in this effort, which again has achieved tremendous successes last year as we defeated ISIS in Syria and we deprived them the territorial control.


	The challenges are enormous and they continue to be so, and this is the Middle East, and there’s never a dull moment, as they say. But with friends like you, sir, we know that we will continue to be able to tackle them, and I – and we look forward in Jordan to working with you on achieving the peace and stability that this region wants. And again, I welcome you here and I look forward to many further meetings. Thank you, sir.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Thanks for the kind words, Foreign Minister Safadi. It’s wonderful to be here. Thank you for the incredibly warm welcome I received here today. I’m thrilled to be here in Jordan on my very first trip as Secretary of State. I told the foreign minister that I came here before I went to my office. So I’m kind of on my way to work. (Laughter.)


	I came here to signal how important Jordan is to the United States. Our partnership is essential to both countries, our friendship between America and His Majesty King Abdullah, and I wanted to come here also to reaffirm all of those ties. This is indispensable to our two nations and I think to the region as well.


	As President Trump said when he welcomed King Abdullah to the White House, we are deeply committed to preserving our strong relationship and to strengthening America’s longstanding support for Jordan. Support for Jordan’s security and stability is an important national interest of the United States. We want the Jordanian people to know this. We want you to know that our commitment to your country is firm. The United States is the single largest donor of economic, security, and humanitarian assistance to Jordan. We’re quite proud of that. We think it’s the right thing to do.


	In February, the United States and Jordan signed a new five-year MOU in which we committed to provide over $6.3 billion in bilateral foreign assistance to Jordan over the next five years. This increase comes at a time when Jordan is facing an adverse impact of conflict on its border. The conflict raging in Syria remains a threat to Jordanian peace and security. We’ll continue to work with Jordan to help the Kingdom defend its borders, always. We must not let Syria again become a safe haven for ISIS or for any other terrorist group.


	The United States goals for Syria are clear: defeat ISIS; ensure the safe delivery of humanitarian aid; de-escalate the violence – something we spoke about at some length this morning; deter the use of chemical weapons; and ultimately, support a political resolution to the conflict. We remain fully committed to the ceasefire arrangement in southwest Syria. The United States strongly supports the UN efforts in Geneva to end this conflict which has gone on for far too many years.


	Throughout the Syrian crisis, Jordan has provided an extraordinary level of assistance to the Syrian people. Thank you so much. We know it’s costly and we know it’s difficult, but your leadership of your neighbors at this incredibly challenging time is extraordinary. The United States, too, has helped Jordan manage this refugee influx, providing nearly $1.1 billion in humanitarian aid to Jordan since the start of the conflict in Syria.


	Turning to Middle East peace, when the President announced that the United States would recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, he also announced that the United States is not taking a position on boundaries or borders, and will support a two-state solution if the parties agree to it. The specific boundaries of Israel’s sovereignty in Jerusalem remain subject to negotiation between those parties. The United States continues to support the status quo with regard to the Haram al-Sharif/Temple Mount, and as Vice President Pence reaffirmed just in January here in Amman, we are committed to continuing to respect Jordan’s special role as the custodian of those holy sites in Jerusalem. We will continue to work for peace in the great hope of offering the best outcome for both the Israeli and Palestinian people.


	Finally, both of our countries know the threat that Iran poses to the region. This morning we had a chance to discuss how best to counter Iran’s malign influence and activity in the region, and with all of our allies we’ve had discussions with respect to the JCPOA.


	We will continue to work together to support bilateral ties between the United States and Jordan. We’re going to make progress on these key regional issues. And we will move forward to ensure a stable and safe Middle East with Jordan as our ally and partner.


	Thank you for hosting me here in Jordan today. It’s been a pleasure.


FOREIGN MINISTER SAFADI: Thank you, Secretary.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Thank you.


MODERATOR: We will take a few questions.


QUESTION: (Speaks in Arabic.)


FOREIGN MINISTER SAFADI: (Speaks in Arabic.)


SECRETARY POMPEO: So the foreign minister and I did have a long discussion about this. Our – we are together jointly in perfect accord with respect to how to proceed with the objectives in Syria. It is a Geneva-based process led by the UN to achieve a political resolution to continue to de-escalate the conflict so that we can begin to resolve all of the various political challenges that are faced there.


	You asked in particular about our – the strikes that were undertaken by the United States and the French. It is the case that the use of chemical weapons is special and unique, and President Trump has made very, very clear that this is intolerable; it presents enormous risk to the world if we don’t re-establish a deterrence framework for the use of chemicals in combat.


QUESTION: Minister and Mr. Secretary, thank you for taking our questions. Secretary Pompeo, in the past four weeks since the Palestinians began protesting in Gaza, 45 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli security forces. Do you have any concerns that excessive force was used? Do you agree with your colleague here that the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is the most serious threat to stability in the region? And do you think that the two-state solution is the only way that it can be resolved, as your colleague seems to?


SECRETARY POMPEO: So let me try and take the three questions there and try to take them in reverse – reverse chronological order. With respect to the two-state solution, the parties will ultimately make the decision about what the right resolution is. We’re certainly open to a two-party solution. That’s a likely outcome. We certainly believe that the Israelis and Palestinians need to have political engagement. We urge the Palestinians to return to that political dialogue.


	Second, it is an important piece of achieving Middle East stability is to resolve this conflict. So precisely how to rank it amongst all the various challenges – I’ll defer on that. Know that it is an incredible priority for the United States to provide whatever assistance we can to allow the two parties to come to a resolution of this incredibly longstanding and important conflict.


	Then your first question is about the activities in Gaza over the past days and weeks. We do believe the Israelis have the right to defend themselves, and we’re fully supportive of that.


QUESTION: (Speaks in Arabic.)


SECRETARY POMPEO: So two questions. The deal-of-the-century question. We understand that ultimately this deal will be agreed to between the Israelis and the Palestinians, but certainly it’s the case that as America continues to be involved in facilitating such an arrangement, we’re doing so in close alignment with Jordan and the Jordanian people so that we’re working together so that the solution that is ultimately achieved works for those two countries and for the greater region as well, including the important interest that Jordan has in that.


	With respect to Syria, I think we’ve talked about this. We believe there are many countries, including the United States, that will play an important political role in achieving the de-escalation and the ultimate political resolution in Syria.


FOREIGN MINISTER SAFADI: (Speaks in Arabic.)

",Press Availability With Jordanian Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi,http://www.state.gov/secretary/remarks/2018/281310.htm
"April 30, 2018","
SECRETARY POMPEO: Everybody ready to get home?


QUESTION: Very much so.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Yeah, me too. Well, look, you all had a chance to see what the prime minister said today. You’ve seen the statement that I’ve released with some of the President – what was said in our response to the question at the joint press conference he held. I’m happy to ask any – answer any questions to clarify anything about this new material that the prime minister released today.


QUESTION: How long have you known about that?


QUESTION: Did you go over it when you were with him in their meeting? I mean, how much of the meeting was that?


SECRETARY POMPEO: So we have – we’ve known about this material for a while. And yes, we certainly discussed the material yesterday when we were together.


QUESTION: Thank you.


SECRETARY POMPEO: But it’s been something that’s been in the works for a while. I know there are people talking about these documents not being authentic. I can confirm for you that these documents are real; they’re authentic.


QUESTION: Senator Corker says you’ve known about this for years.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Well, that’s partly true. The existence of the AMAD program that ended roughly December of 2003, January of 2004, it is accurate to say that the knowledge of that has been known for – the fact of that had been known for quite some time. But there are thousands of new documents and new information. We’re still going through it. There’s still a lot of work to do to figure out precisely the scope and scale of it. But it is the case – it – there is new information about that program.


QUESTION: Does it matter for the Iran nuclear deal, I mean, given that it looks like they abandoned the program some time ago?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Well, this is – this will, I think, spell out the scope and scale of the program that they undertook there, and I think makes – I think makes very clear that, at the very least, the Iranians have continued to lie to their own people. So while you say everyone knew, the Iranians have consistently taken the position that they’ve never had a program like this. This will – this will belie any notion that there wasn’t a program like this.


QUESTION: Is there anything in there that suggests there’s an actual violation of the 2016 agreement?


SECRETARY POMPEO: We’ll leave that to lawyers. I’ll leave that to lawyers to sort of make – and the President will ultimately have to make a determination about that too. You should remember there are still many, many documents that we’ve not had the opportunity to go through yet. It’s complex, a lot of translation work. There’s just a – it’s just a significant undertaking.


QUESTION: Does this suggest that the IAEA was wrong when it closed the book on the PMDs as part of the – part of the JCPOA?


SECRETARY POMPEO: I don’t know the answer to that.


QUESTION: Well, do these documents – are they contemporaneous with the negotiations that were going on or the (inaudible)?


SECRETARY POMPEO: We haven’t gone through all the documents yet. We’re still scratching the surface of what we’re going through.


QUESTION: Did the prime minister choose to release this now in order to influence the President’s decision or to support it?


SECRETARY POMPEO: I don’t know. I don’t know why they chose that timing.


QUESTION: It sounds like you have not drawn any conclusions on it yet.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Well, yes and no. I mean, it depends what you mean. Yes, we’ve drawn conclusions. We know more about the AMAD program than we knew before, and we have a whole lot more material to go through. We now know that they continued to store this material in an orderly fashion for some purpose – right? They kept the documents for a reason, and one can speculate as to why. If you said you were never – right? – the JCPOA says you’ll never, ever have a nuclear weapons program – right? Or maybe not with a not a never ever. You won’t ever have a nuclear weapons program. But you chose to store in secret and hide these documents?


QUESTION: Historical record? You’re not willing to give them the benefit of the doubt that they don’t want to destroy their history or --


SECRETARY POMPEO: The world can decide if this was for the Iranian museum that they – that they decided to hang onto it. (Laugher.)


QUESTION: How much have you guys (inaudible)?


QUESTION: Secretary, what happens now? Do you (inaudible) urgent meeting of the E3? What happens now?


SECRETARY POMPEO: So the Israelis will now, I think – I think the prime minister said publicly they are going to go provide expert briefings to the Germans and the French (inaudible). They’ll do the same thing for the Brits as well, and I think he indicated he was going to do it for the other members of the P5 also. And I think that’s important. I don’t think the Israelis – the Israelis haven’t asked us to take their word for it; they provided us the material to review. I am confident they will do the same for the other partners of the P5.


QUESTION: If you --


MODERATOR: Okay, guys. The Secretary has to go.


QUESTION: How much will it damage European relations? I mean, they obviously want to stay very much in the deal. If you pull out, are you afraid that relations with Europe will be damaged?


SECRETARY POMPEO: I’d say two things. One, we’re working diligently to fix this thing. I mean, on the plane we’ve been working to try and get language right that will address President Trump’s concerns. So we’re still working our way there.


	And then a second thing I’d say is we’ve had lots of conversations with the Europeans. We know what it is they’re hoping to achieve. We share the same end goal to keep the Iranians from ever having a nuclear weapon. I am confident that we will continue to have good relations with our European partners should the President choose to pull out of this. This will be one issue among many of the important, critical issues that we all work on together.


MODERATOR: All right. Thanks, you guys.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Thank you all.

We extend our deepest condolences to the families and friends of the victims who were injured and killed, and we mourn all those who lost their lives.


	The independent media is a cornerstone of democracy. Despite today’s attack, the vibrant media landscape that has developed in Afghanistan will endure, in large part due to those journalists and media professionals who tragically died in today’s attack, but whose courageous and steadfast work helped lay the foundation for Afghanistan’s thriving and resilient independent media. The international community’s commitment to the Afghan people and a lasting peace in Afghanistan will not be shaken by such attacks.


The United States, along with our Afghan and international partners, is committed to defeating ISIS in Afghanistan, which has claimed responsibility for this attack. We stand with the people, the independent media, and government of Afghanistan and remain committed to supporting the Afghan people’s efforts to achieve peace, security, and democracy for their country.

PRIME MINISTER NETANYAHU: Good afternoon. Secretary Pompeo, Mike, it’s wonderful to welcome you. This is your first visit to Israel as Secretary of State. I think it’s significant that you chose, as did the President, to include Israel on this important itinerary. I think it’s symbolic of our friendship, which is deep, and getting even deeper and stronger. We’ve known each other for some time, I followed your activities in Congress and then as CIA, now as Secretary of State. You’re a true friend of Israel, a true friend of the Jewish people, and I look forward to working with you in your new role. We’ve just had very productive, very focused conversations on our common interests and how to defend our common value.


	I want to thank again President Trump for his historic decision on recognizing Jerusalem as Israel’s capital. We look forward to welcoming the American delegation to celebrate the relocation of the embassy with you, Ambassador Friedman. I must tell you that the bold decision by President Trump has prompted other countries – there are quite a few now who are planning to move their embassy to Jerusalem as well. It says something about American leadership and about the forthright way in which simple truths are being put forward and the effect this has on the international scene.


	Mr. Secretary, I think the greatest threat to the world and to our two countries and to all countries is the marriage of militant Islam with nuclear weapons, and specifically, the attempt of Iran to acquire nuclear weapons. We’ve had a very productive talk today on this subject as well. I appreciate the President’s leadership and your position on stopping Iran from ever acquiring nuclear weapons. I appreciate the President’s and your position on stopping Iran’s aggression in the region. That aggression has grown many-fold since the signing of the Iranian deal. If people thought that Iran’s aggression would be moderated as a result of signing the deal, the opposite has happened, and Iran is trying to gobble up one country after the other. Iran must be stopped. Its quest for nuclear bombs must be stopped. Its aggression must be stopped. And we’re committed to stopping it together.


	I was very much encouraged, once again, by the steadfast support of the United States for Israel and for this common effort, which encompasses many other countries, as you know – as you well know, Mr. Secretary. But our bond is special. It’s based on shared values of democracy, freedom, the quest for security and peace, and I can say that today America and Israel are closer than ever before. And I have no doubt that our alliance will grow even closer in the years ahead.


	So I want to welcome you back to Israel, Mr. Secretary. It’s a pleasure to see you and I wish you the best of luck in your important mission. Thank you.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Thank you. Thank you so much. Thank you.


	Well, good afternoon. It is a great honor to be here on my first trip as Secretary of State. I’ve been the Secretary for a handful of hours. As I was saying earlier, I haven’t been to my office yet.


	As you said, this relationship’s never been stronger, and I think we should both be proud of that. We had fantastic conversations today on difficult issues facing each of us. We are incredibly proud to be opening the new embassy on May 14th, well ahead of the original timetable. This step comes as Israel celebrates its 70th anniversary of independence and 70 years of recognition as steadfast support for Israel from the American people as well. By recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and the seat of its government, we’re recognizing reality. I also stress, as President Trump has said in December, the boundaries of Israeli sovereignty in Jerusalem remain subject to negotiations between the parties, and we remain committed to achieving a lasting and comprehensive peace that offers a brighter future for both Israel and the Palestinians.


	Many of our conversations today, Mr. Prime Minister, as you said, centered on Iran. Strong cooperation with close allies like you is critical to our efforts to counter Iran’s destabilizing and malign activity throughout the Middle East and indeed throughout the world. We remain deeply concerned about Iran’s dangerous escalation of threats to Israel and the region, and Iran’s ambition to dominate the Middle East remains. The United States is with Israel in this fight and we strongly support Israel’s sovereign right to defend itself.


	Regarding the JCPOA, President Trump’s been pretty clear. This deal is very flawed. He’s directed the administration to try and fix it, and if we can’t fix it, he’s going to withdraw from the deal. It’s pretty straightforward. Unlike the past administration, President Trump has a comprehensive Iran strategy that is designed to counter the full array of threats emanating from Tehran.


	As part of the President’s comprehensive Iran strategy, we are also working to counter the broad set of non-nuclear threats: Iran’s missile systems, its support for Hizballah, the importation of thousands of proxy fighters into Syria, and its assistance to the Houthi rebels in Yemen. We look forward to working closely with strong allies like Israel in countering these threats and rolling back the full range of Iranian malign influence.


	Regarding Syria, where the barbaric Assad regime is propped up by Iran, the United States’ top priorities are to defeat ISIS, de-escalate violence, deter the use of chemical weapons, and ensure the safe delivery of humanitarian aid and support an ultimate political resolution to the conflict. Our strategy to do that remains unchanged. We strongly support the UN-led efforts in Geneva to bring an end to the Syrian conflict, which has gone on for far too long.


	We know there are many challenges ahead and we look forward to being your partner in resolving each of them. The United States and Israel I know together can achieve that. It’s great to be back.


PRIME MINISTER NETANYAHU: Thank you.

FOREIGN MINISTER AL-JUBEIR: (Interpretation) Inaudible…today. I would like to welcome my colleague and friend Mr. Michael Pompeo, Secretary of State of the friendly United States of America in his first visit today as Secretary of State visiting the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabia is the first stop for him in his trip to the Middle East since he took office a few days ago. So, your Excellency, welcome to your second country, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.


The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the United States are connected by very deep historical and strategic relationships. There are mutual interests on many trajectories; whether on military, commercial, social, and educational. The country which receives the most Saudi students is the U.S. The biggest trading partner, or the biggest investor, in Saudi Arabia is the U.S., and Saudi Arabia is one of the biggest investors in the U.S.


In his visit, his Excellency met with the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques. Yesterday, he met with HRH the Crown Prince, Deputy Prime Minister, and Minister of Defense, Prince Mohammed bin Salman. After the meeting, there was a working dinner. Also, I met with my counterpart yesterday after his arrival to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The meetings were all positive, constructive and fruitful. We have addressed the mutual relationships between the two countries and ways to promote and intensify them in all fields. The challenges in the region have been reviewed, whether in Lebanon, in Syria, supporting Iraq, Iran’s negative interferences in the region, the situation in Yemen, supporting the five countries on the African Coast, and dealing with the crisis in Libya.


Our viewpoints were identical. There was a strong desire to intensify the work and mutual efforts in dealing with all these efforts. Regarding Iran, as we mentioned in the past, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia supports President Trump’s policy towards Iran, and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia supports the efforts to enhance Iran’s Nuclear Deal. We think the period to limit the enrichment of Uranium must be eliminated and eternal. Also, we believe monitoring Iran’s nuclear sites must be intensified. On the Iranian crisis, we also believe there should be more sanctions on Iran --for violating international resolutions regarding ballistic missiles and for supporting terrorism and intervening in the affairs of the courtiers of the region. In this regard, the U.S. and Saudi Arabia have identical viewpoints. And so is the case in all other topics. Your Excellency, I look forward to working with you in the future in all what could serve the interests of our two friendly countries. Again I welcome you to Saud Arabia and thank you very much for you visit.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Well, good afternoon. Adel, it’s great to see you again, and it’s wonderful to be back here. President Trump came to Saudi Arabia on his first international trip, and now I have done so on my first trip as Secretary of State.


We’ve known each other a while, and the two countries have been great partners across a broad spectrum of activities, as you described. Saudi Arabia is a key partner and a longtime friend, and our partnership is growing. I personally have had the chance to work closely with Saudi leaders over the years on many issues and I look forward to building upon those good works in my new role as Secretary of State.


I would like to thank His Majesty King Salman and His Royal Highness Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman for hosting me here on this trip. President Trump was recently pleased to welcome the crown prince to the United States. During his visit, the crown prince met with dozens of U.S. government and business leaders, and I built upon those meetings in conversation last night during dinner with the crown prince.


Adel and I covered a lot of ground during our meeting. We discussed Iran, Syria, Yemen, and Gulf relations. The foreign minister knows that Saudi Arabia’s security is a priority for the United States of America. We’ll continue to work closely with our Saudi partners to counter threats to this country’s security.


That, of course, starts with Iran. Iran destabilizes this entire region. It supports proxy militias and terrorist groups. It arms – it is an arms dealer to the Houthi rebels in Yemen, and Iran conducts cyber hacking campaigns. It supports the murderous Assad regime as well. Unlike the prior administration, we will not neglect the vast scope of Iran’s terrorism. It is indeed the greatest sponsor of terrorism in the world, and we are determined to make sure it never possesses a nuclear weapon. The Iran deal in its current form does not provide that assurance. We will continue to work with our European allies to fix that deal, but if a deal cannot be reached, the President has said that he will leave that deal.


I also want to highlight today that the nuclear deal has failed to moderate the regime’s conduct in many other areas. I highlighted a few. In fact, Iran has only behaved worse since the deal was approved. In Yemen, Iran continues to support the violent Houthi rebels by providing military equipment, funding, and training. This is in violation of the UN Security Council resolutions. The Houthis continue to fire missiles into Saudi Arabia on a regular basis, targeting Red Sea shipping and threatening the Saudi people.


While we will continue to assist Saudi Arabia with its defense needs and support its right to defend its own borders, a political solution is the only way to advance long-term stability in Yemen and end the suffering, and I know we agree on that. Adel and I agreed to fully support the new UN envoy’s efforts to advance a political settlement that ends the civil war – an enduring solution to this conflict and the dire humanitarian situation that has followed from it.


The longstanding political and security vacuum created by the conflict, as well as deteriorating humanitarian conditions, have also been exploited in Yemen by al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula and by ISIS. When these groups are given safe haven, the U.S. homeland is at risk.


President Trump’s first trip to Saudi Arabia was historic, and I reminded the king how much President Trump appreciated that trip. While he was here, he attended the opening of the Global Center for Combating Extremist Ideology. I asked Minister Jubeir for an update on the work of the center. It represents a clear declaration that Muslim majority countries must take the lead in combating terrorism and radicalization around the world. America is prepared to stand with Saudi Arabia in pursuit of the shared interests and security, but as President Trump has said and said at the Riyadh summit as well, the nations of the Middle East cannot wait for American power to crush terrorism for them. Muslim nations must be willing to take on that burden.


If we’re going to conquer extremism and defeat the forces of terrorism together, I know that Saudi Arabia will be at the front of it. We all must honestly confront the crisis of Islamist extremism and the Islamist terror groups it inspires, and this does indeed mean standing together against the murder of innocent Muslims, the oppression of women, the persecution of Jews, and the slaughter of Christians.


Saudi Arabia’s vision for 2030 and the reform agenda of the crown prince are inspiring initiatives. They promote tolerance, respect, and economic development, and they empower women. We strongly support this important work and the leadership that the crown prince has shown to advance our shared economic interests.


I also stressed to the foreign minister that Gulf unity is necessary. We need to achieve it.


I enjoyed a great deal spending time with the king today. It has been a pleasure to be back in Saudi Arabia among so many of my good friends. I thank you for receiving me, for my hospitality. I know that I will travel here frequently, and I look forward to welcoming you in Washington, D.C. as well.


FOREIGN MINISTER AL-JUBEIR: Thank you very – thank you --


SECRETARY POMPEO: Thank you for your graciousness.

"April 29, 2018","
MS NAUERT: And I told them, sir, on the record, we only have five minutes, and we’re talking about Saudi portion of the trip. We don’t want to get ahead of Israel.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Sounds great. Who’s got something (Inaudible.)


QUESTION: How’d it go? (Laughter.)


SECRETARY POMPEO: It went great. The folks I was meeting were old friends, people I’ve known for quite some time, and they are fantastic partners and we share an enormous amount of interests (inaudible) Saudis (inaudible) national security meetings were cordial. We had some good discussions, and we wanted to make sure we were completely in sync. For the most part I think we share a great deal (inaudible) in terms of how we think about keeping stability.


QUESTION: Did you convince them to sort of settle the dispute with Qatar?


SECRETARY POMPEO: They’ll all figure it out.


QUESTION: That’s a no, then.


QUESTION: Is there any indication --


SECRETARY POMPEO: They’re going to figure out how to resolve this. I think they would all agree that it’s in everyone’s best interest if the Gulf states all figure out how to be together to meet the common challenge in Iran. They all recognize that. We’re hopeful that they will either (inaudible) figure out how to resolve the disputes between them.


QUESTION: (Inaudible) help you out more in northeast Syria?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Yeah, I think we had good conversations about that. It’s a complicated problem in Syria, as I think everyone would acknowledge, they would too, but my sense is that as we develop our plan forward, State Department will have its political component, right, in Geneva and the work that Secretary Mattis and his team have been doing on ground to build a coalition to help achieve our objectives, and I’m confident that the Saudis will work alongside us to help get there.


QUESTION: The Saudis have said that – al-Jubeir has said – has told my colleague --


SECRETARY POMPEO: Sorry?


QUESTION: The foreign ministry has told our colleagues that they are ready to move on troops on the ground if needed, but they’re waiting for the U.S.


SECRETARY POMPEO: We need to make sure we get it right. This is literally a situation so complex you want to measure twice and cut once, right? So I want to make sure we have our policies completely aligned, and at that time we’ll sit down and talk about how it’s the case that we can best make sure, as I think I mentioned in my remarks, that this is not America alone working on this, it is the Gulf states working alongside us to take care of their own region.


QUESTION: You spoke about the Iran nuclear deal. What was their – what was your take away from that? And can you rip up one nuclear deal while trying to forge a second one with North Korea? Doesn’t – isn’t that a contradiction?


SECRETARY POMPEO: No, no contradiction at all in my view. With – the first question was about their view. I think their view is similar to ours, which is the deal was inadequate. We need to try and fix it. They were hopeful. I gave them an update on our progress from my trip to Brussels, about the progress we’ve made with the Europeans. We’ve certainly made some, there’s still work to do. And they said great, we’ll support you if you get the fixes that are very much in line with our policy there.


	With respect to the differences in the deal, I am confident that Kim Jong-un is looking for more than a piece of paper, right? He’s not just staring at this North Korean deal and saying, “Oh goodness, there was this Iran agreement between President Obama and the Iranians, and I’m going to rely on the fact that the Americans stayed in that to have confidence that the Americans will do the right thing if I give up my nuclear weapons.” He’s going to look for aligning our interests, right, setting up – what we talked about is concrete, irreversible actions, assurances, that provided him with assurance that if we are able to be successful in changing this it will be lasting. So I don’t think Kim Jong-un is staring at the Iran deal and saying, “Oh goodness, if they get out of that deal, I won’t talk to the Americans anymore.” There are higher priorities that he is more concerned about than whether or not the Americans stay in the JCPOA.


QUESTION: What are you expecting on the missile issue? I mean, is it just more sanctions, is it intercepting shipments from Iran --


SECRETARY POMPEO: I don’t want to talk about the status of negotiations. It’s a live issue and we’re making progress, and we’ve got to make sure everybody’s in the same place. So I’m going to save that until it’s complete.


QUESTION: Was there any discussion about the potential for a larger deal involving Syria and things with the Iran deal the way Macron had thrown forward?


SECRETARY POMPEO: You mean with respect to the JCPOA? So it’s certainly the case that what the President’s asked for in terms of a fix is a more comprehensive solution – that is, it won’t be just about the nuclear file. One of the core fixes is to make sure we’re addressing those other risks, that Iranian malign behavior and missiles. So if we’re successful in getting the fixes, it will certainly be broader than the JCPOA.


QUESTION: Would it involve actors like Russia or Turkey the way that Macron had thrown out?


SECRETARY POMPEO: I’m sorry, one more time?


QUESTION: Would it involve actors like Russia and Turkey? This is one of the things that had been discussed.


SECRETARY POMPEO: I don’t know. I don’t know. See how far we can get.


MS NAUERT: He’s got to go.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Thank you all.


MS NAUERT: Thanks, guys.

SECRETARY POMPEO: Thank you.

"April 28, 2018","
QUESTION: Secretary Pompeo, thank you for joining us on your very first trip as Secretary of State.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Thank you, Jonathan. It’s great to be with you.


QUESTION: So I want to start with those incredible images that we saw of Kim Jong-un stepping into South Korea – the first time we have ever seen a North Korean dictator do that, how big, how significant, was that moment?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Yeah, Jonathan, I think it’s a big deal. It’s important. Every step along the way matters. The objective remains the same: complete, verifiable, irreversible denuclearization. That’s been the administration’s goal. President Trump has put economic pressure on the North Koreans, and it appears to have given us this opening, this real opportunity for something that would be transformative for the world if we can achieve it.


QUESTION: And let’s look at those – more remarkable images of your meeting with Kim Jong-un, the two of you just standing there side-by-side. What was going through your mind at that moment?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Well, I was on a mission, Jonathan. I had a mission to begin to lay the groundwork for President Trump’s meeting with Kim Jong-un. We wanted to make sure we understood that the North Koreans, Kim Jong-un, was prepared to talk about the things that matter most to give us a grounds, a basis, to have that meeting between the President and the chairman. I was very focused on that in that moment.


QUESTION: The President said that the meeting, the meeting between the two of you, was entirely unplanned and it lasted for more than an hour. How did it come about?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Well, I was there on a mission. I was aiming to achieve the goals the President set forward to me. It became clear that I was going to get the chance to meet with Kim Jong-un to discuss some of the details, but most importantly, to take a read on whether there was an opportunity here for our two countries to achieve this. And when I came back, I reported in to the President the discussion. It was a productive one. There remains a great deal of work to do, but we at least have an opportunity here to do something that’s incredibly important.


QUESTION: As the CIA director, you obviously spent a lot of time and the CIA has spent years, resources on trying to read the North Korean leadership, trying to understand Kim Jong-un. What did you come away learning about him in that meeting?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Well, any time you get a chance to meet face to face with someone you get a better read about what they’re thinking, whether they’re really prepared to do something that is historic and different. And we’ve got a long history in negotiating with North Korea. Repeatedly, they have taken actions, only to find that those promises proved false or unworthy, or they were uncapable of achieving them. My goal was to try and identify if there was a real opportunity there. I believe there is. Who knows how the ultimate discussions will go. There is a lot of work left to do, but I’m very hopeful that the conditions that have been set by President Trump give us this chance.


QUESTION: The President said that you have a good relationship with Kim Jong-un after this – a good relationship. Do you?


SECRETARY POMPEO: We had a good conversation. We talked about serious matters. He was very well prepared; I hope I matched that. We had a extensive conversation on the hardest issues that face our two countries. I had a clear mission statement from President Trump. When I left there, Kim Jong-un understood the mission exactly as I’ve described it today, and he agreed that he was prepared to talk about that and to lay out a map that would help us achieve that objective. Only time will tell if we can get that done.


QUESTION: So you went there to set up this summit meeting between Kim Jong-un and the President or to take steps towards doing that. What do you – looking at this, what is your assessment? What is the best plausible outcome that can – that we can see after this first meeting of Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Well, we hope a number of things could be achieved. I talked about getting the release of the American detainees, and then we talked a great deal about what it might look like, what this complete, verifiable, irreversible mechanism might look like. And so when the two leaders – the only people who can make those decisions – will be in a room together, they can set the course; they can chart the outcome; they can then direct the teams to go deliver that outcome. And the best outcome would be that, that the two agree that they’re going to get there and charter their teams to go make that happen.


QUESTION: So I want to play for you something that the National Security Advisor John Bolton said shortly before he came into the administration but right after this planned meeting was announced. This is what he said about negotiating with the North Koreans: “There’s an all-purpose joke here. Question: How do you know that the North Korean regime is lying? Answer: Their lips are moving.”


	So that was obviously before John Bolton became national security advisor. He’s now working on this meeting. But given all of the broken promises on the nuclear issue that we have seen under President Clinton, President Bush, President Obama, three different North Korean leaders now, can you really trust anything that comes out of – out of a meeting with Kim Jong-un?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Jonathan, this administration has its eyes wide open. We know the history; we know the risks. We’re going to be very different. We’re going to negotiate in a different way than has been done before. We’re going to require those steps. We use the word “irreversible” with great intention. We’re going to require those steps that demonstrate that denuclearization is going to be achieved. We’re not going to take promises. We’re not going to take words. We’re going to look for actions and deeds. And until such time, the President has made incredibly clear we will keep the pressure campaign in place until we achieve that. That’s different. And so in each case, both countries will have to do more than words. We’ll have to actually deliver an outcome that is the one that Kim Jong-un and I had the chance to talk about at the direction of the President.


QUESTION: So you looked – you looked into his eyes. You spent more than an hour with him. You said it was a good conversation. The President said it was a good relationship that was developed. The President has also called him a madman. The President is not alone in calling Kim Jong-un a madman. How do you – how do you build a relationship with somebody who is seen as a madman?


SECRETARY POMPEO: I’m not one to do much about navel gazing or eye staring. I’m looking for actions. And that’s what President Trump is asking for too. We have built a coalition. A diplomatic coalition has come together to put pressure on Kim Jong-un. President Trump and that pressure campaign are the reasons Kim Jong-un wants this meeting. It’s the objective of our administration to achieve the outcome. That’s what we’ll be looking for between the President and Kim Jong-un.


QUESTION: Do you think he’s really had a change of heart on this? I mean, if you look at Kim Jong-un, this is somebody who assassinated his uncle right after coming into power, poisoned his half-brother, did more to advance North Korea’s nuclear facilities, its missile capabilities, than his father, did more to advance the military than his grandfather. Do you really think that he has had a change of heart on this and he is ready to give up the pride of that country right now, its nuclear program?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Kim Jong-un is going to have to make a decision. He is going to have to make a big decision. Does he want the pressure campaign to continue? Does he want President Trump to continue to place him in the location that he finds himself today? Or is he looking for something big and bold and different, something that hasn’t happened before?


	I don’t know which way it will go. As the President has said, only time will tell. But we have a mission set. We have an obligation to engage in diplomatic discourse to try and find a peaceful solution so that Americans aren’t held at risk by Kim Jong-un and his nuclear arsenal. That’s the mission. That’s the goal. Only time will tell if we’re going to be able to achieve it.


QUESTION: And you’ve been clear this is complete, irreversible dismantlement of their nuclear programs, get rid of the nukes, get rid of the capabilities. Is he going to get any --


SECRETARY POMPEO: Yes, sir.


QUESTION: Is he going to get anything in return before he does that, or is there any lifting, any easing of sanctions, any reward given, before the total, irreversible dismantling of that nuclear program?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Jonathan, the administration has been very clear. We’ll see how the negotiations proceed, but we’re going to do it in a fundamentally different way than the previous efforts to persuade the North Koreans to get rid of their nuclear weapons program. We have our eyes wide open, Jonathan.


QUESTION: But nothing before it’s done? No partial steps?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Jonathan, we have our eyes wide open.


QUESTION: You were CIA director for 15 months. You had a sense, you’ve got – you’ve seen all the intelligence on this. We’ve seen the assessments. Are you confident that we truly know the extent of the North Korean nuclear program? Do we know where his bombs are? Do we know where all his nuclear facilities are at this point?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Jonathan, I’m not going to go into any detail on that.


QUESTION: Well, I’m just asking if you’re confident in the assessment. I’m not asking you what the assessment is. Do you believe – because he’s – he’s hidden nuclear capability in the past --


SECRETARY POMPEO: Jonathan, Jonathan, I’m not going to – I’m not going to talk about intelligence matters on the show this morning. I apologize for that. I just – you understand that I simply can’t do that.


QUESTION: So if diplomacy fails on this, is there a military option? Is there a realistic military option for getting rid of that nuclear program?


SECRETARY POMPEO: The President has been very clear, Jonathan. We’re not going to allow Kim Jong-un to continue to threaten America. We’re not going to let him develop a program such that Americans are held at risk.


QUESTION: I want to play something you said in July at the Aspen Forum --


SECRETARY POMPEO: Jonathan, I’m sorry. Jonathan, I’m sorry. I’m going to – I apologize. I’m going to have to run.


QUESTION: Can I – can I just ask you one more question before we head out here?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Sure.


QUESTION: I want to play something you said at the Aspen Forum in July: “The North Korean people, I am sure, are lovely people and would love to see him go as well. As you might know, they don’t live a very good life there.” So that was in July. That now – since then, you have been to North Korea, you have met directly with Kim Jong-un. Do you still think that the people there in North Korea would like to see him go?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Jonathan, what I said that evening I still believe. The people of North Korea live in very difficult conditions. I believe that one of the reasons that Kim Jong-un is engaged in this conversation is that the pressure campaign that has been applied by President Trump and, indeed, by the world has put them in an even more tenuous, more difficult position. And so I am optimistic. We will work hard to see if we can’t find a solution so that the North Korean people can, in fact, live a better life.


QUESTION: Our thanks to Secretary Pompeo, who spoke to us from Saudi Arabia.

SECRETARY POMPEO: Good afternoon, everyone. It’s truly been an honor to be here in Brussels today. I received a very warm welcome from my counterparts. It’s never good to be late on your first day of work, and so after being sworn in I hustled here. The flight crew did great work to get me here and lots of great State Department officers helped me get this set up so I could be here in the nick of time.


	It was important to me. There’s no more fitting destination for my first foreign trip as the Secretary of State than a meeting of our NATO allies. This alliance has been an essential pillar of American security interests for decades. Some of our strongest bilateral partnerships are encompassed within this alliance, and I made it clear today that the United States is eager to continue to lead here in NATO.


	Our commitment, the United States commitment to the collective defense under Article 5 of the Washington Treaty remains ironclad. As President Trump said, the alliance has been the bulwark of international peace and security for nearly 70 years, and it will remain so.


	Threats to our common security come from many sources and we must address them all to keep people safe around the world. Our collective defense demands greater burden sharing. During the Wales Summit in 2014, all NATO allies agreed to increase defense spending to 2 percent of gross domestic product by 2024 with 20 percent of that share devoted to funding major equipment. It’s now up to each ally to make good on that promise by presenting a credible plan before the summit in July.


	European nations must bear the necessary responsibilities for their security and make the case to their fellow citizens why it is critical to fulfill their obligations on defense spending, investing capabilities essential to the long-term defense of their countries, and address threats emanating from neighboring regions.


	Russia threatens allies and partners both militarily, as seen through its invasions of Georgia in 2008 and Ukraine in 2014, and through an aggressive campaign to undermine western democratic institutions. In light of Russia’s unacceptable actions, NATO is more indispensable than ever. As NATO allies agree, the use of military-grade nerve agent developed by Russia on UK territory was a reckless action that put the lives of innocent civilians at risk.


	The United States has made abundantly clear that NATO should not return to business as usual with Russia until Moscow shows a clear change in its actions and complies with international law.


	President Trump has also made clear that fighting terrorism must be a major focus of NATO. The alliance should work with our partners in North Africa and the Middle East to address conditions and activities that enable terrorism, such as traffic of weapons, irregular migration, and regional instability.


	NATO’s expertise can help strengthen the resilience of partner countries as well. We call on NATO to increase its interactions with regional organizations that are fighting terrorism.


	The United States is unwavering in our support for NATO’s open-door policy as well, and our commitment that any Euro-Atlantic country that wishes to join the alliance and meets the requirements may do so. We will continue to work with aspirants bilaterally and through NATO structures to help them meet those standards. And as the alliance works towards the July summit here in Brussels, we will focus on three priorities: increased defense spending and burden sharing, strengthening NATO’s deterrence and defense, and countering terrorism. We look forward to making progress on each of those issues in July.


	I also want to congratulate the Republic of Korea and North Korea on the historic meeting, and the Korean people’s aspirations for peace and prosperity. Let there be no doubt: We would not be where we are today without President Trump’s maximum pressure campaign and the work that has been done all around the world to apply pressure to North Korea. We are encouraged by President Moon and Leader Kim Jong-un’s stated goal of complete denuclearization in the Panmunjom Declaration. We’re studying the declaration closely to understand whether Leader Kim made any new commitments as part of this agreement.


	Our objective remains unchanged. We’re committed to permanent, verifiable, irreversible dismantling of North Koreans’ weapons of mass destruction programs without delay. Until then, the global maximum pressure campaign will continue. As the President has said, the United States will not repeat the mistakes of the past. These talks and any others do not supersede any UN Security Council resolutions or any other sanctions.


	As always, the United States will continue to coordinate closely with our allies, the Republic of Korea and Japan, on our unified response. North Korean promises are good, but transparent, verifiable action is essential.


	And with that, I’m happy to take a couple of questions.


MS NAUERT: Okay, sir. We’ll start with Carol Morello from The Washington Post. Carol.


QUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Secretary. You are going to be leaving tomorrow for the Middle East. Do you have any plans to give a heads-up to the leaders you will be meeting with in three countries regarding the Iran deal decision? Or have you heard anything from the Europeans here today that has made you think that it might make more sense to stay in the deal while you are working on the supplemental issues?


	And if I may, when you return to Washington, you will be facing a demoralized yet hopeful workforce. What are some of the first things you plan to do at the State Department to turn things around?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Let me take the second one first. I do look forward to getting to work in Washington. I’ll be out there on Tuesday. And I’ve talked about this a lot. I just met with a great group of State Department officers who work here at the mission. They may have been demoralized, but they seemed in good spirits. They are hopeful that the State Department will get its swagger back, that we will be out doing the things that they came onboard at the State Department to do. To be professional, to deliver diplomacy, American diplomacy around the world – that’s my mission set, is to build that esprit and get the team on the field so that we can effectuate American diplomacy. I know that the State Department and the people there can do that.


	With respect to the JCPOA, we talked about it some today. I’m confident that that’ll be a topic on my trip throughout the Middle East as well, not only talking about the concerns that President Trump has expressed consistently, but talking about ways to potentially address those shortcomings, finding a potential solution to the very flaws that President Trump has identified for a long time now.


	You asked if we talked about the decision. There’s been no decision made. So the team is working, and I’m sure we’ll have lots of conversations to deliver what the President has made clear. Absent a substantial fix, absent overcoming the shortcomings, the flaws of the deal, he is unlikely to stay in that deal past this May.


MS NAUERT: Okay, our next question goes to Ansgar Haase for DPA. Are you here?


QUESTION: Yeah.


MS NAUERT: That’s you. Okay, go right – go right ahead, sir.


QUESTION: Secretary, when you look at the figures that were presented until now, do you think Germany is doing enough to meet the 2 percent target?


SECRETARY POMPEO: No. (Laughter.)


QUESTION: What should Germany do?


SECRETARY POMPEO: They should meet the goals that they agreed to. Look, this is – look, it’s – it is the case over the past months that there has been progress made and lots of countries who are doing better. I think President Trump made that a priority. I think many of the NATO allies have, in turn, made it a priority for their country as well. I applaud that. I’m thrilled with that. But the goal remains clear, or the goals remain clear. That’s the expectation. It’s the expectation not only for Germany but for everyone who signed up for that agreement. So we’re hopeful that at the summit every NATO partner will deliver a credible plan to achieve that goal. That’s what they signed up for. That’s our expectation for July.


MS NAUERT: Okay, next question goes to Lesley Wroughton from Reuters. Lesley.


QUESTION: Do I need a mike?


MS NAUERT: It’s coming your way.


QUESTION: Thank you. Mr. Secretary, I want to ask you: Did a consensus emerge today on how to counter hybrid warfare emanating from Russia and elsewhere, and what concrete steps did you agree will be necessary?


	And if I might just follow up on something on North Korea. The White House just released a photo of you and Kim Jong-un meeting. A central question on North Korea is if he poses – if it poses a unique threat because Kim is dangerously unstable. You’ve met him. Do you think he’s unstable, or do you think that he’s serious about reaching a deal?


SECRETARY POMPEO: What was your first question? (Laughter.)


QUESTION: On Russia.


SECRETARY POMPEO: I actually remember.


QUESTION: Okay.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Look, we had a lot of discussions about ways to put – push back against Russia. President Trump has made very clear, and so the choice is really up to Vladimir Putin and the Russians. We would love nothing more than them to rejoin, right, the democratic world and behave in ways that they’re not doing today. So very much prepared to have that dialogue; it’s their choice if they want to be part of that or not.


	And to the extent they choose not to – and you were talking about hybrid warfare in particular – we talked a lot about that, the changing nature of the threat from Russia. When I was a young soldier it was T-72 tanks and T-60 tanks rolling across the then East German plain. This today is different. And we collectively, each nation individually, and NATO together, must come up with solutions to address that.


	There were lots of ideas. There was enormous consensus of the risk that it poses to the West, those hybrid war activities pose to the West, and there is a real commitment to work together to mitigate those risks and to deter them from taking place in the first instance.


MS NAUERT: Our – pardon me, sir.


SECRETARY POMPEO: I was just going to – the second part, on Kim Jung-un, I don’t want to say anything about the meeting itself.


QUESTION: Did you get a sense that he was serious?


SECRETARY POMPEO: Yes, I did get a sense that he was serious. The economic pressure that has been put in place by this global effort that President Trump has led has led him to believe that it’s in his best interest to come to the table and talk about denuclearization.


	So I’m – I’m always careful. There’s a lot of history here, where promises have been made, hopes have been raised and then dashed. President Trump has made clear we’re going to – we’re going to work to get a meeting set up. The two of them will meet. In the event that it fails, respectfully, President Trump will walk away, and then the pressure will remain. But in the event we reach a resolution, it would be a wonderful thing for the world.


MS NAUERT: Okay. And our final question goes to Iryna Somer from UNIAN. Iryna.


QUESTION: Thank you. Iryna Somer, Ukrainian news agency UNIAN. And obviously, my question will be on Ukraine. Ministers today discussed aspiration, Ukrainian aspiration to join NATO. Can you please give us a flavor of this discussion? Did you actually discuss a request of President Poroshenko to provide Ukraine membership action plan? And what is your opinion on this issue? Thank you.


SECRETARY POMPEO: So there was discussion today about Ukraine, Ukraine’s potential entry to be a NATO partner, that there’s much work to do along the way to achieve that. I think that I’m always careful to describe consensus when there were lots of differing voices about how to approach it and what the right action set ought to be to achieve it, but I think there – I think there was a large group who are hopeful that the Ukrainians will begin to take the actions that would put them in a place where they could, in fact, be an aspirant to become a NATO member.


MS NAUERT: Everyone, thank you. Thank you so much.


SECRETARY POMPEO: Okay, thank you, all.


MS NAUERT: Mr. Secretary, thank you. We’ve had an awfully long day, as you can imagine.
